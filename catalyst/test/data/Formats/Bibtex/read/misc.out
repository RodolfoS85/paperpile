abstract: |
 The similarity of two nucleotide sequences is often expressed in
 terms of evolutionary distance, a measure of the amount of change
 needed to transform one sequence into the other. Given two sequences
 with a small distance between them, can their similarity be explained
 by their base composition alone? The nucleotide order of these
 sequences contributes to their similarity if the distance is much
 smaller than their average permutation distance, which is obtained by
 calculating the distances for many random permutations of these
 sequences. To determine whether their similarity can be explained by
 their dinucleotide and codon usage, random sequences must be chosen
 from the set of permuted sequences that preserve dinucleotide and
 codon usage. The problem of choosing random dinucleotide and
 codon-preserving permutations can be expressed in the language of
 graph theory as the problem of generating random Eulerian walks on a
 directed multigraph. An efficient algorithm for generating such walks
 is described. This algorithm can be used to choose random sequence
 permutations that preserve (1) dinucleotide usage, (2) dinucleotide
 and trinucleotide usage, or (3) dinucleotide and codon usage. For
 example, the similarity of two 60-nucleotide DNA segments from the
 human beta-1 interferon gene (nucleotides 196-255 and 499-558) is not
 just the result of their nonrandom dinucleotide and codon usage.
