    Observations of GRB 100724B with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) find
  that the spectrum is dominated by the typical Band functional form, which is
  usually taken to represent a non-thermal emission component, but also includes
  a statistically highly significant thermal spectral contribution. The
  simultaneous observation of the thermal and non-thermal components allows us to
  confidently identify the two emission components. The fact that these seem to
  vary independently favors the idea that the thermal component is of
  photospheric origin while the dominant non-thermal emission occurs at larger
  radii. Our results imply either a very high efficiency for the non-thermal
  process, or a very small size of the region at the base of the flow, both quite
  challenging for the standard fireball model. These problems are resolved if the
  jet is initially highly magnetized and has a substantial Poynting flux.
