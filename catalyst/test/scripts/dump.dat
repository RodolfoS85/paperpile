abstract: 'MOTIVATION: In eukaryotes, the family of non-coding RNA genes includes a number of genes encoding small nucleolar RNAs (mainly C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs), which act as guides in the maturation or post-transcriptional modifications of target RNA molecules. Since in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) only few examples of snoRNAs have been identified so far by cDNA libraries screening, integration of the molecular data with in silico identification of these types of genes could throw light on their organization in the Dm genome. RESULTS: We have performed a computational screening of the Dm genome for C/D snoRNA genes, followed by experimental validation of the putative candidates. Few of the 26 confirmed snoRNAs had been recognized by cDNA library analysis. Organization of the Dm genome was also found to be more variegated than previously suspected, with snoRNA genes nested in both the introns and exons of protein-coding genes. This finding suggests that the presence of additional mechanisms of snoRNA biogenesis based on the alternative production of overlapping mRNA/snoRNA molecules.

abstract: 'The similarity of two nucleotide sequences is often expressed in terms of evolutionary distance, a measure of the amount of change needed to transform one sequence into the other. Given two sequences with a small distance between them, can their similarity be explained by their base composition alone? The nucleotide order of these sequences contributes to their similarity if the distance is much smaller than their average permutation distance, which is obtained by calculating the distances for many random permutations of these sequences. To determine whether their similarity can be explained by their dinucleotide and codon usage, random sequences must be chosen from the set of permuted sequences that preserve dinucleotide and codon usage. The problem of choosing random dinucleotide and codon-preserving permutations can be expressed in the language of graph theory as the problem of generating random Eulerian walks on a directed multigraph. An efficient algorithm for generating such walks is described. This algorithm can be used to choose random sequence permutations that preserve (1) dinucleotide usage, (2) dinucleotide and trinucleotide usage, or (3) dinucleotide and codon usage. For example, the similarity of two 60-nucleotide DNA segments from the human beta-1 interferon gene (nucleotides 196-255 and 499-558) is not just the result of their nonrandom dinucleotide and codon usage.'

abstract: "In many sexually dimorphic species, a mechanism is required to ensure equivalent levels of gene expression from the sex chromosomes. In mammals, such dosage compensation is achieved by X-chromosome inactivation, a process that presents a unique medley of biological puzzles: how to silence one but not the other X chromosome in the same nucleus; how to count the number of X's and keep only one active; how to choose which X chromosome is inactivated; and how to establish this silent state rapidly and efficiently during early development. The key to most of these puzzles lies in a unique locus, the X-inactivation centre and a remarkable RNA--Xist--that it encodes."

abstract: 'BACKGROUND:Whole genome sequencing of marine cyanobacteria has revealed an unprecedented degree of genomic variation and streamlining. With a size of 1.66 megabase-pairs, Prochlorococcus sp. MED4 has the most compact of these genomes and it is enigmatic how the few identified regulatory proteins efficiently sustain the lifestyle of an ecologically successful marine microorganism. Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) control a plethora of processes in eukaryotes as well as in bacteria; however, systematic searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for most eubacterial phyla outside the enterobacteria.RESULTS:Based on a computational prediction we show the presence of several ncRNAs (cyanobacterial functional RNA or Yfr) in several different cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus-Synechococcus lineage. Some ncRNA genes are present only in two or three of the four strains investigated, whereas the RNAs Yfr2 through Yfr5 are structurally highly related and are encoded by a rapidly evolving gene family as their genes exist in different copy numbers and at different sites in the four investigated genomes. One ncRNA, Yfr7, is present in at least seven other cyanobacteria. In addition, control elements for several ribosomal operons were predicted as well as riboswitches for thiamine pyrophosphate and cobalamin.CONCLUSION:This is the first genome-wide and systematic screen for ncRNAs in cyanobacteria. Several ncRNAs were both computationally predicted and their presence was biochemically verified. These RNAs may have regulatory functions and each shows a distinct phylogenetic distribution. Our approach can be applied to any group of microorganisms for which more than one total genome sequence is available for comparative analysis.'

abstract: "An unusual RNA molecule encoded by the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 is a structural component of the viral prohead and is required for the ATP-dependent packaging of DNA. Here we report a model of secondary structure for this prohead RNA developed from a phylogenetic analysis of the primary sequences of prohead RNAs of related phages. Twenty-nine phages related to phi 29 were found to produce prohead RNAs. These RNAs were analyzed by their ability to replace phi 29 RNA in in vitro phage assembly, by Northern blot hybridization with a probe complementary to phi 29 RNA, and by partial and complete sequence analyses. These analyses revealed four quite different sequences ranging in length from 161 to 174 residues. The secondary structure deduced from these sequences, in agreement with earlier observations, indicated that prohead RNA is organized into two domains. The larger 5'-domain (Domain I) is composed of 113-117 residues and contains four helices. Three of these helices appear to be organized into a central stem that is interrupted by two unpaired loops and the fourth helix and loop. The smaller 3'-domain (Domain II) is composed of 40-44 residues and consists of two helices. Domains I and II are separated by 8-13 unpaired residues. Nuclease cleavage occurs readily in this single-stranded joining region, and this cleavage allows the subsequent separation of the two RNA domains. The separated Domain I is fully active in DNA packaging in vitro. The functional significance and biological role of Domain II are unknown. The phylogenetic secondary structure model provides a basis for further analysis of the role of this RNA in bacteriophage morphogenesis."

abstract: 'There are 481 segments longer than 200 base pairs (bp) that are absolutely conserved (100% identity with no insertions or deletions) between orthologous regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. Nearly all of these segments are also conserved in the chicken and dog genomes, with an average of 95 and 99% identity, respectively. Many are also significantly conserved in fish. These ultraconserved elements of the human genome are most often located either overlapping exons in genes involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development. Along with more than 5000 sequences of over 100 bp that are absolutely conserved among the three sequenced mammals, these represent a class of genetic elements whose functions and evolutionary origins are yet to be determined, but which are more highly conserved between these species than are proteins and appear to be essential for the ontogeny of mammals and other vertebrates.'

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: It is currently believed that the human genome contains about twice as much non-coding functional regions as it does protein-coding genes, yet our understanding of these regions is very limited. RESULTS: We examine the intersection between syntenically conserved sequences in the human, mouse and rat genomes, and sequence similarities within the human genome itself, in search of families of non-protein-coding elements. For this purpose we develop a graph theoretic clustering algorithm, akin to the highly successful methods used in elucidating protein sequence family relationships. The algorithm is applied to a highly filtered set of about 700 000 human-rodent evolutionarily conserved regions, not resembling any known coding sequence, which encompasses 3.7% of the human genome. From these, we obtain roughly 12 000 non-singleton clusters, dense in significant sequence similarities. Further analysis of genomic location, evidence of transcription and RNA secondary structure reveals many clusters to be significantly homogeneous in one or more characteristics. This subset of the highly conserved non-protein-coding elements in the human genome thus contains rich family-like structures, which merit in-depth analysis.

abstract: 'We describe improvements of the currently most popular method for prediction of classically secreted proteins, SignalP. SignalP consists of two different predictors based on neural network and hidden Markov model algorithms, where both components have been updated. Motivated by the idea that the cleavage site position and the amino acid composition of the signal peptide are correlated, new features have been included as input to the neural network. This addition, combined with a thorough error-correction of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3, correctness of the cleavage site predictions has increased notably for all three organism groups, eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction has increased in the range 6-17% over the previous version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of false-positive predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural network. The new method has been benchmarked against other available methods. Predictions can be made at the publicly available web server'

abstract: "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs of 21-25 nucleotides that specifically regulate cellular gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs are derived from the maturation by cellular RNases III of imperfect stem loop structures of 70 nucleotides. Evidence for hundreds of miRNAs and their corresponding targets has been reported in the literature for plants, insects, invertebrate animals, and mammals. While not all of these miRNA/target pairs have been functionally verified, some clearly serve roles in regulating normal development and physiology. Recently, it has been queried whether the genome of human viruses like their cellular counterpart also encode miRNA. To date, there has been only one report pertaining to this question. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to encode five miRNAs. Here, we extend the analysis of miRNA-encoding potential to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Using computer-directed analyses, we found that HIV putatively encodes five candidate pre-miRNAs. We then matched deduced mature miRNA sequences from these 5 pre-miRNAs against a database of 3' untranslated sequences (UTR) from the human genome. These searches revealed a large number of cellular transcripts that could potentially be targeted by these viral miRNA (vmiRNA) sequences. We propose that HIV has evolved to use vmiRNAs as a means to regulate cellular milieu for its benefit."

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Structured non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have a very important functional role in the cell. No distinctive general features common to all ncRNA have yet been discovered. This makes it difficult to design computational tools able to detect novel ncRNAs in the genomic sequence. RESULTS: We devised an algorithm able to detect conserved secondary structures in both pairwise and multiple DNA sequence alignments with computational time proportional to the square of the sequence length. We implemented the algorithm for the case of pairwise and three-way alignments and tested it on ncRNAs obtained from public databases. On the test sets, the pairwise algorithm has a specificity greater than 97% with a sensitivity varying from 22.26% for Blast alignments to 56.35% for structural alignments. The three-way algorithm behaves similarly. Our algorithm is able to efficiently detect a conserved secondary structure in multiple alignments.'

abstract: 'We define a &quot;threaded blockset,&quot; which is a novel generalization of the classic notion of a multiple alignment. A new computer program called TBA (for &quot;threaded blockset aligner&quot;) builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that different projections present consistent predictions of which genomic positions are orthologous. This capability is illustrated using a new visualization tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa Cruz Genome Browser.'

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Most non-coding RNAs are characterized by a specific secondary and tertiary structure that determines their function. Here, we investigate the folding energy of the secondary structure of non-coding RNA sequences such as microRNA precursors, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs in several eukaryotic taxa. Statistical biases are assessed by a randomization test, in which the predicted minimum free energy of folding is compared with values obtained for structures inferred from randomly shuffling the original sequences. RESULTS: In contrast with transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, the majority of the microRNA sequences clearly exhibit a folding free energy that is considerably lower than that for shuffled sequences, indicating a high tendency in the sequence towards a stable secondary structure. A possible usage of this statistical test in the framework of the detection of genuine miRNA sequences is discussed. AVAILABILITY: The dataset, software and additional data files are freely available as supplementary information on our website. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: http://www.pbs.ugent.be/bioinformatics/.'

abstract: 'The support vector machine (SVM) approach represents a data-driven method for solving classification tasks. It has been shown to produce lower prediction error compared to classifiers based on other methods like artificial neural networks, especially when large numbers of features are considered for sample description. In this review, the theory and main principles of the SVM approach are outlined, and successful applications in traditional areas of bioinformatics research are described. Current developments in techniques related to the SVM approach are reviewed which might become relevant for future functional genomics and chemogenomics projects. In a comparative study, we developed neural network and SVM models to identify small organic molecules that potentially modulate the function of G-protein coupled receptors. The SVM system was able to correctly classify approximately 90% of the compounds in a cross-validation study yielding a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.78. This classifier can be used for fast filtering of compound libraries in virtual screening applications.'

abstract: 'Currently there is no successful computational approach for identification of genes encoding novel functional RNAs (fRNAs) in genomic sequences. We have developed a machine learning approach using neural networks and support vector machines to extract common features among known RNAs for prediction of new RNA genes in the unannotated regions of prokaryotic and archaeal genomes. The Escherichia coli genome was used for development, but we have applied this method to several other bacterial and archaeal genomes. Networks based on nucleotide composition were 80-90% accurate in jackknife testing experiments for bacteria and 90-99% for hyperthermophilic archaea. We also achieved a significant improvement in accuracy by combining these predictions with those obtained using a second set of parameters consisting of known RNA sequence motifs and the calculated free energy of folding. Several known fRNAs not included in the training datasets were identified as well as several hundred predicted novel RNAs. These studies indicate that there are many unidentified RNAs in simple genomes that can be predicted computationally as a precursor to experimental study. Public access to our RNA gene predictions and an interface for user predictions is available via the web.'

abstract: "Using high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing essentially all nonrepetitive sequences on human chromosomes 21 and 22, we map the binding sites in vivo for three DNA binding transcription factors, Sp1, cMyc, and p53, in an unbiased manner. This mapping reveals an unexpectedly large number of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) regions, with a minimal estimate of 12,000 for Sp1, 25,000 for cMyc, and 1600 for p53 when extrapolated to the full genome. Only 22% of these TFBS regions are located at the 5' termini of protein-coding genes while 36% lie within or immediately 3' to well-characterized genes and are significantly correlated with noncoding RNAs. A significant number of these noncoding RNAs are regulated in response to retinoic acid, and overlapping pairs of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs are often coregulated. Thus, the human genome contains roughly comparable numbers of protein-coding and noncoding genes that are bound by common transcription factors and regulated by common environmental signals."

abstract: 'In our recent series of papers, we have used the structures of statistical significance from Monte Carlo simulations to improve the predictions of secondary structure of RNA and to analyze the possible role of locally significant structures in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus. Because of intensive computational requirements for Monte Carlo simulation, it becomes impractical even using a supercomputer to assess the significance of a structure with a window size greater than 200 along an RNA sequence of 1000 bases or more. In this paper, we have developed a new procedure that drastically reduces the time needed to assess the significance of structures. In fact, the efficiency of this new method allows us to assess structures on the VAX as well as the CRAY.'

abstract: 'Sites of transcription of polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNAs for 10 human chromosomes were mapped at 5-bp resolution in eight cell lines. Unannotated, nonpolyadenylated transcripts comprise the major proportion of the transcriptional output of the human genome. 19.4%, 43.7%, and 36.9% of all transcribed sequences were observed to be polyadenylated, nonpolyadenylated, and bimorphic, respectively. Half of all transcribed sequences are found only in the nucleus and for the most part are unannotated. Overall, the transcribed portions of the human genome are predominately composed of interlaced networks of both poly A+ and A- annotated transcripts and unannotated transcripts of unknown function. This organization has important implications for interpreting genotype-phenotype associations, regulation of gene expression, and the definition of a gene.'

abstract: 'The steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) has previously been characterized as belonging to the growing family of functional non-coding RNAs. However, we recently reported the Western blot detection of a putative endogenous SRA protein (SRAP) in breast cancer cells. Herein, we successfully suppressed the expression of this protein through specific RNA interference assay, unequivocally confirming its existence. Moreover, using database searches and Western blot analysis, we also showed that SRAP is highly conserved among chordata. Overall, our results suggest that SRA is the first example of a new class of functional RNAs also able to encode a protein.'

abstract: 'Comparative sequence analysis has facilitated the discovery of protein coding genes and important functional sequences within proteins, but has been less useful for identifying functional sequence elements in nonprotein-coding DNA because the relatively rapid rate of change of nonprotein-coding sequences and the relative simplicity of non-coding regulatory sequence elements necessitates the comparison of sequences of relatively closely related species. We tested the use of comparative DNA sequence analysis to aid identification of promoter regulatory elements, nonprotein-coding RNA genes, and small protein-coding genes by surveying random DNA sequences of several Saccharomyces yeast species, with the goal of learning which species are best suited for comparisons with S. cerevisiae. We also determined the DNA sequence of a few specific promoters and RNA genes of several Saccharomyces species to determine the degree of conservation of known functional elements within the genome. Our results lead us to conclude that comparative DNA sequence analysis will enable identification of functionally conserved elements within the yeast genome, and suggest a path for obtaining this information.'

abstract: "We present results of computer experiments that indicate that several RNAs for which the native state (minimum free energy secondary structure) is functionally important (type III hammerhead ribozymes, signal recognition particle RNAs, U2 small nucleolar spliceosomal RNAs, certain riboswitches, etc.) all have lower folding energy than random RNAs of the same length and dinucleotide frequency. Additionally, we find that whole mRNA as well as 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, and cds regions of mRNA have folding energies comparable to that of random RNA, although there may be a statistically insignificant trace signal in 3'-UTR and cds regions. Various authors have used nucleotide (approximate) pattern matching and the computation of minimum free energy as filters to detect potential RNAs in ESTs and genomes. We introduce a new concept of the asymptotic Z-score and describe a fast, whole-genome scanning algorithm to compute asymptotic minimum free energy Z-scores of moving-window contents. Asymptotic Z-score computations offer another filter, to be used along with nucleotide pattern matching and minimum free energy computations, to detect potential functional RNAs in ESTs and genomic regions."

abstract: 'We present an analysis of rates and patterns of microevolutionary phenomena that have shaped the human, mouse, and rat genomes since their last common ancestor. We find evidence for a shift in the mutational spectrum between the mouse and rat lineages, with the net effect being a relative increase in GC content in the rat genome. Our estimate for the neutral point substitution rate separating the two rodents is 0.196 substitutions per site, and 0.65 substitutions per site for the tree relating all three mammals. Small insertions and deletions of 1-10 bp in length (&quot;microindels&quot;) occur at approximately 5% of the point substitution rate. Inferred regional correlations in evolutionary rates between lineages and between types of sites support the idea that rates of evolution are influenced by local genomic or cell biological context. No substantial correlations between rates of point substitutions and rates of microindels are found, however, implying that the influences that affect these processes are distinct. Finally, we have identified those regions in the human genome that are evolving slowly, which are likely to include functional elements important to human biology. At least 5% of the human genome is under substantial constraint, most of which is noncoding.'

abstract: 'We present a highly accurate method for identifying genes with conserved RNA secondary structure by searching multiple sequence alignments of a large set of candidate orthologs for correlated arrangements of reverse-complementary regions. This approach is growing increasingly feasible as the genomes of ever more organisms are sequenced. A program called MSARI implements this method and is significantly more accurate than existing methods in the context of automatically generated alignments, making it particularly applicable to high-throughput scans. In our tests, it discerned CLUSTALW-generated multiple sequence alignments of signal recognition particle or RNaseP orthologs from controls with 89.1% sensitivity at 97.5% specificity and with 74.4% sensitivity with no false positives in 494 controls. We used MSARI to conduct a comprehensive scan for secondary structure in mRNAs of coding genes, and we found many genes with known mRNA secondary structure and compelling evidence for secondary structure in other genes. MSARI uses a method for coping with sequence redundancy that is likely to have applications in a large set of other comparison-based search methods. The program is available for download from http://theory.csail.mit.edu/MSARi.'

abstract: "BACKGROUND: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found in bacteria, post-transcriptionally regulates expression of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) by interaction with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR. Phylogenetic data can be useful for RNA/RNA duplex structure analyses and aid in elucidation of mechanism of regulation. However micF and associated genes, ompF and ompC are difficult to annotate because of either similarities or divergences in nucleotide sequence. We report by using sequences that represent \"gene signatures\" as probes, e.g., mRNA 5'UTR sequences, closely related genes can be accurately located in genomic sequences. RESULTS: Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST programs have been used to identify micF, ompF and ompC in Yersinia pestis and Yersinia enterocolitica. By alignment with DNA sequences from other bacterial species, 5' start sites of genes and upstream transcriptional regulatory sites in promoter regions were predicted. Annotated genes from Yersinia species provide phylogenetic information on the micF regulatory system. High sequence conservation in binding sites of transcriptional regulatory factors are found in the promoter region upstream of micF and conservation in blocks of sequences as well as marked sequence variation is seen in segments of the micF RNA gene. Unexpected large differences in rates of evolution were found between the interacting RNA transcripts, micF RNA and the 5' UTR of the ompF mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex structures were modeled by the mfold program. Functional domains such as RNA/RNA interacting sites appear to display a minimum of evolutionary drift in sequence with the exception of a significant change in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Newly annotated Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the resultant RNA/RNA duplex structures add strong phylogenetic support for a generalized duplex model. The alignment and search approach using 5' UTR signatures may be a model to help define other genes and their start sites when annotated genes are available in well-defined reference organisms."

abstract: "Sequence conservation in non-coding, upstream regions of orthologous genes from man and mouse is likely to reflect common regulatory DNA sites. Motivated by this assumption we have delineated a catalogue of conserved non-coding sequence blocks and provide the CORG-'COmparative Regulatory Genomics'-database. The data were computed based on statistically significant local suboptimal alignments of 15 kb regions upstream of the translation start sites of, currently, 10 793 pairs of orthologous genes. The resulting conserved non-coding blocks were annotated with EST matches for easier detection of non-coding mRNA and with hits to known transcription factor binding sites. CORG data are accessible from the ENSEMBL web site via a DAS service as well as a specially developed web service (http://corg.molgen.mpg.de) for query and interactive visualization of the conserved blocks and their annotation."

abstract: 'A detailed understanding of the functions and interactions of biological macromolecules requires knowledge of their molecular structures. Structural genomics, the systematic determination of all macromolecular structures represented in a genome, is focused at present exclusively on proteins. It is clear, however, that RNA molecules play a variety of significant roles in cells, including protein synthesis and targeting, many forms of RNA processing and splicing, RNA editing and modification, and chromosome end maintenance. To comprehensively understand the biology of a cell, it will ultimately be necessary to know the identity of all encoded RNAs, the molecules with which they interact and the molecular structures of these complexes. This report focuses on the feasibility of structural genomics of RNA, approaches to determining RNA structures and the potential usefulness of an RNA structural database for both predicting folds and deciphering biological functions of RNA molecules.'

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on probabilistic modeling can be developed using stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine different sources of information that can be expressed probabilistically, such as an evolutionary model of comparative RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical model of structure plausibility. However, the number of free parameters in an integrated model for consensus RNA structure prediction can become untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too complex. Thus a key question is, what small, simple SCFG designs perform best for RNA secondary structure prediction? RESULTS: Nine different small SCFGs were implemented to explore the tradeoffs between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Each model was tested for single sequence structure prediction accuracy on a benchmark set of RNA secondary structures. CONCLUSIONS: Four SCFG designs had prediction accuracies near the performance of current energy minimization programs. One of these designs, introduced by Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only 21 free parameters and is significantly simpler than the others.'

abstract: 'Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes produce functional RNA molecules rather than encoding proteins. However, almost all means of gene identification assume that genes encode proteins, so even in the era of complete genome sequences, ncRNA genes have been effectively invisible. Recently, several different systematic screens have identified a surprisingly large number of new ncRNA genes. Non-coding RNAs seem to be particularly abundant in roles that require highly specific nucleic acid recognition without complex catalysis, such as in directing post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression or in guiding RNA modifications.'

abstract: We describe a general approach to several RNA sequence analysis problems using probabilistic models that flexibly describe the secondary structure and primary sequence consensus of an RNA sequence family. We call these models 'covariance models'. A covariance model of tRNA sequences is an extremely sensitive and discriminative tool for searching for additional tRNAs and tRNA-related sequences in sequence databases. A model can be built automatically from an existing sequence alignment. We also describe an algorithm for learning a model and hence a consensus secondary structure from initially unaligned example sequences and no prior structural information. Models trained on unaligned tRNA examples correctly predict tRNA secondary structure and produce high-quality multiple alignments. The approach may be applied to any family of small RNA sequences.

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Noncoding RNA genes produce functional RNA molecules rather than coding for proteins. One such family is the H/ACA snoRNAs. Unlike the related C/D snoRNAs these have resisted automated detection to date. RESULTS: We develop an algorithm to screen the yeast genome for novel H/ACA snoRNAs. To achieve this, we introduce some new methods for facilitating the search for noncoding RNAs in genomic sequences which are based on properties of predicted minimum free-energy (MFE) secondary structures. The algorithm has been implemented and can be generalized to enable screening of other eukaryote genomes. We find that use of primary sequence alone is insufficient for identifying novel H/ACA snoRNAs. Only the use of secondary structure filters reduces the number of candidates to a manageable size. From genomic context, we identify three strong H/ACA snoRNA candidates. These together with a further 47 candidates obtained by our analysis are being experimentally screened.'

abstract: "This study describes comprehensive polling of transcription start and termination sites and analysis of previously unidentified full-length complementary DNAs derived from the mouse genome. We identify the 5' and 3' boundaries of 181,047 transcripts with extensive variation in transcripts arising from alternative promoter usage, splicing, and polyadenylation. There are 16,247 new mouse protein-coding transcripts, including 5154 encoding previously unidentified proteins. Genomic mapping of the transcriptome reveals transcriptional forests, with overlapping transcription on both strands, separated by deserts in which few transcripts are observed. The data provide a comprehensive platform for the comparative analysis of mammalian transcriptional regulation in differentiation and development."

abstract: 'We describe EnteriX, a suite of three web-based visualization tools for graphically portraying alignment information from comparisons among several fixed and user-supplied sequences from related enterobacterial species, anchored on a reference genome (http://bio.cse.psu.edu/). The first visualization, Enteric, displays stacked pairwise alignments between a reference genome and each of the related bacteria, represented schematically as PIPs (Percent Identity Plots). Encoded in the views are large-scale genomic rearrangement events and functional landmarks. The second visualization, Menteric, computes and displays 1 Kb views of nucleotide-level multiple alignments of the sequences, together with annotations of genes, regulatory sites and conserved regions. The third, a Java-based tool named Maj, displays alignment information in two formats, corresponding roughly to the Enteric and Menteric views, and adds zoom-in capabilities. The uses of such tools are diverse, from examining the multiple sequence alignment to infer conserved sites with potential regulatory roles, to scrutinizing the commonalities and differences between the genomes for pathogenicity or phylogenetic studies. The EnteriX suite currently includes &gt;15 enterobacterial genomes, generates views centered on four different anchor genomes and provides support for including user sequences in the alignments.'

abstract: 'To date, few attempts have been made to benchmark the alignment algorithms upon nucleic acid sequences. Frequently, sophisticated PAM or BLOSUM like models are used to align proteins, yet equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids; instead, rather ad hoc models are generally favoured. Here, we systematically test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving the following goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural RNA alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate &lt;50-60% sequence identity. Second, we note that the probabilistic method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms generally outperform other sequence-based algorithms, under the broadest range of applications.'

abstract: 'We present here a new approach to the problem of defining RNA signatures and finding their occurrences in sequence databases. The proposed method is based on &quot;secondary structure profiles&quot;. An RNA sequence alignment with secondary structure information is used as an input. Two types of weight matrices/profiles are constructed from this alignment: single strands are represented by a classical lod-scores profile while helical regions are represented by an extended &quot;helical profile&quot; comprising 16 lod-scores per position, one for each of the 16 possible base-pairs. Database searches are then conducted using a simultaneous search for helical profiles and dynamic programming alignment of single strand profiles. The algorithm has been implemented into a new software, ERPIN, that performs both profile construction and database search. Applications are presented for several RNA motifs. The automated use of sequence information in both single-stranded and helical regions yields better sensitivity/specificity ratios than descriptor-based programs. Furthermore, since the translation of alignments into profiles is straightforward with ERPIN, iterative searches can easily be conducted to enrich collections of homologous RNAs.'

abstract: 'Recently, we identified a large number of ultraconserved (uc) sequences in noncoding regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny. Here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related Anopheles gambiae. As with vertebrates, ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences, and at intron-exon junctions. The sequences are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators and transcription factors, but are less frequent and are smaller in size than in vertebrates. The longest identical, nongapped orthologous match between the three genomes was found within the homothorax (hth) gene. This sequence spans an internal exon-intron junction, with the majority located within the intron, and is predicted to form a highly stable stem-loop RNA structure. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of different hth splice isoforms and Northern blotting showed that the conserved element is associated with a high incidence of intron retention in hth pre-mRNA, suggesting that the conserved intronic element is critically important in the post-transcriptional regulation of hth expression in Diptera.'

Detection of such cis-acting elements in genome-wide screenings may significantly contribute to genome annotation and comparative analysis as well as to target functional characterization experiments. We present here PatSearch, a flexible and fast pattern matcher able to search for specific combinations of oligonucleotide consensus sequences, secondary structure elements and position-weight matrices. It can also allow for mismatches/mispairings below a user fixed threshold. We report three different applications of the program in the search of complex patterns such as those of the iron responsive element hairpin-loop structure, the p53 responsive element and a promoter module containing CAAT-, TATA- and cap-boxes.

abstract: 'One notable feature of linear dsDNA viruses is that, during replication, their lengthy genome is squeezed with remarkable velocity into a preformed procapsid and packed into near crystalline density. A molecular motor using ATP as energy accomplishes this energetically unfavorable motion tack. In bacterial virus phi29, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital component of this motor. This 120-base RNA has many novel and distinctive features. It contains strong secondary structure, is tightly folded, and unusually stable. Upon interaction with ion and proteins, it has a knack to adapt numerous conformations to perform versatile function. It can be easily manipulated to form stable homologous monomers, dimers, trimers and hexamers. As a result, many unknown properties of RNA have been and will be unfolded by the study of this extraordinary molecule. This article reviews the structure and function of this pRNA and focuses on novel methods and unique approaches that lead to the illumination of its structure and function.'

abstract: 'MicroRNAs are a family of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The two founding members of the microRNA family were originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as genes that were required for the timed regulation of developmental events. Since then, hundreds of microRNAs have been identified in almost all metazoan genomes, including worms, flies, plants and mammals. MicroRNAs have diverse expression patterns and might regulate various developmental and physiological processes. Their discovery adds a new dimension to our understanding of complex gene regulatory networks.'

abstract: 'As an essential nutrient and a potential toxin, iron poses an exquisite regulatory problem in biology and medicine. At the cellular level, the basic molecular framework for the regulation of iron uptake, storage, and utilization has been defined. Two cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) and IRP-2, respond to changes in cellular iron availability and coordinate the expression of mRNAs that harbor IRP-binding sites, iron-responsive elements (IREs). Nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 also signal to IRPs and thereby influence cellular iron metabolism. The recent discovery of two IRE-regulated mRNAs encoding enzymes of the mitochondrial citric acid cycle may represent the beginnings of elucidating regulatory coupling between iron and energy metabolism. In addition to providing insights into the regulation of iron metabolism and its connections with other cellular pathways, the IRE/IRP system has emerged as a prime example for the understanding of translational regulation and mRNA stability control. Finally, IRP-1 has highlighted an unexpected role for iron sulfur clusters as post-translational regulatory switches.'

abstract: Most functional RNA molecules have characteristic secondary structures that are highly conserved in evolution. Here we present a method for computing the consensus structure of a set aligned RNA sequences taking into account both thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation. Comparison with phylogenetic structures of rRNAs shows that a reliability of prediction of more than 80% is achieved for only five related sequences. As an application we show that the Early Noduline mRNA contains significant secondary structure that is supported by sequence covariation.

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional RNAs, most prominently the miRNAs have been discovered, strongly suggesting that further types of functional RNAs are still hidden in the recently completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA genes. When sufficiently similar sequences are not available for comparative approaches the only known remedy is to search directly for structural features. RESULTS: We present here efficient algorithms for computing locally stable RNA structures at genome-wide scales. Both the minimum energy structure and the complete matrix of base pairing probabilities can be computed in O(N x L(2)) time and O(N + L(2)) memory in terms of the length N of the genome and the size L of the largest secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice, the 100 Mb of the complete genome of Caenorhabditis elegans can be folded within about half a day on a modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is sufficient example for a survey for miRNAs.

abstract: "MOTIVATION: Many classes of functional RNA molecules are characterized by highly conserved secondary structures but little detectable sequence similarity. Reliable multiple alignments can therefore be constructed only when the shared structural features are taken into account. Since multiple alignments are used as input for many subsequent methods of data analysis, structure based alignments are an indispensable necessity in RNA bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present here a method to compute pairwise and progressive multiple alignments from the direct comparison of basepairing probability matrices. Instead of attempting to solve the folding and the alignment problem simultaneously as in the classical Sankoff algorithm we use McCaskill's approach to compute base pairing probability matrices which effectively incorporate the information on the energetics of each sequences. A novel, simplified variant of Sankoff's algorithms can then be employed to extract the maximum weight common secondary structure and an associated alignment. AVAILABILITY: The programs pmcomp and pmmulti described in this contribution are implemented in Perl and can be downloaded together with the example data sets from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/PMcomp/. A web server is available at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/pmcgi.pl."

abstract: "BACKGROUND: Pairwise stochastic context-free grammars (Pair SCFGs) are powerful tools for evolutionary analysis of RNA, including simultaneous RNA sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction, but the associated algorithms are intensive in both CPU and memory usage. The same problem is faced by other RNA alignment-and-folding algorithms based on Sankoff's 1985 algorithm. It is therefore desirable to constrain such algorithms, by pre-processing the sequences and using this first pass to limit the range of structures and/or alignments that can be considered. RESULTS: We demonstrate how flexible classes of constraint can be imposed, greatly reducing the computational costs while maintaining a high quality of structural homology prediction. Any score-attributed context-free grammar (e.g. energy-based scoring schemes, or conditionally normalized Pair SCFGs) is amenable to this treatment. It is now possible to combine independent structural and alignment constraints of unprecedented general flexibility in Pair SCFG alignment algorithms. We outline several applications to the bioinformatics of RNA sequence and structure, including Waterman-Eggert N-best alignments and progressive multiple alignment. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on test examples from the RFAM database. CONCLUSION: A program, Stemloc, that implements these algorithms for efficient RNA sequence alignment and structure prediction is available under the GNU General Public License."

abstract: 'Non-messenger RNAs (nmRNAs) play a wide and essential role in cellular functions. Computational identification of novel nmRNAs in genomes of model organisms is severely restricted owing to their lack of an open reading frame. Hence, we describe experimental approaches for their identification by generating cDNA libraries derived from nmRNAs for which we coined the term experimental RNomics. Two different procedures are introduced for cDNA library construction. First, we describe the construction of a general purpose cDNA library from sized RNA fractions. Second, we introduce a more specialized RNomics strategy employing this approach to generate a cDNA library from a specific abundant class of nmRNAs. This is illustrated using as a paradigm the two families of small nucleolar RNAs that guide modification of nucleotides in rRNAs or spliceosomal RNAs small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by short antisense elements complementary to the modification site. Following the identification of novel members from the class of small nuclear RNAs by experimental RNomics, we demonstrate how their target sequences in rRNAs or snRNAs can be identified.'

abstract: 'RNA secondary structure folding algorithms predict the existence of connected networks of RNA sequences with identical structure. On such networks, evolving populations split into subpopulations, which diffuse independently in sequence space. This demands a distinction between two mutation thresholds: one at which genotypic information is lost and one at which phenotypic information is lost. In between, diffusion enables the search of vast areas in genotype space while still preserving the dominant phenotype. By this dynamic the success of phenotypic adaptation becomes much less sensitive to the initial conditions in genotype space.'

abstract: "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved in translational regulation, as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org. Our analysis suggests that miRNA genes, which are about 1% of all human genes, regulate protein production for 10% or more of all human genes."

abstract: 'Recently, we mapped the sites of transcription across approximately 30% of the human genome and elucidated the structures of several hundred novel transcripts. In this report, we describe a novel combination of techniques including the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and tiling array technologies that was used to further characterize transcripts in the human transcriptome. This technical approach allows for several important pieces of information to be gathered about each array-detected transcribed region, including strand of origin, start and termination positions, and the exonic structures of spliced and unspliced coding and noncoding RNAs. In this report, the structures of transcripts from 14 transcribed loci, representing both known genes and unannotated transcripts taken from the several hundred randomly selected unannotated transcripts described in our previous work are represented as examples of the complex organization of the human transcriptome. As a consequence of this complexity, it is not unusual that a single base pair can be part of an intricate network of multiple isoforms of overlapping sense and antisense transcripts, the majority of which are unannotated. Some of these transcripts follow the canonical splicing rules, whereas others combine the exons of different genes or represent other types of noncanonical transcripts. These results have important implications concerning the correlation of genotypes to phenotypes, the regulation of complex interlaced transcriptional patterns, and the definition of a gene.'

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: A new hidden Markov model method (SAM-T98) for finding remote homologs of protein sequences is described and evaluated. The method begins with a single target sequence and iteratively builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence and homologs found using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is also used to construct model libraries automatically from sequences in structural databases. METHODS: We evaluate the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three of the test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers are determined by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated database. The method is compared against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST, a two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of FASTA. RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all tests-dramatically so for the fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point on the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98 got 880 true positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST got 533 true positives with 71 false positives, and WU-BLASTP got 353 true positives with 24 false positives. The method is optimized to recognize superfamilies, and would require parameter adjustment to be used to find family or fold relationships. One key to the performance of the HMM method is a new score-normalization technique that compares the score to the score with a reversed model rather than to a uniform null model.

abstract: 'Identifying the functional elements encoded in a genome is one of the principal challenges in modern biology. Comparative genomics should offer a powerful, general approach. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on high-quality draft sequences of three related species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus). We first aligned the genomes and characterized their evolution, defining the regions and mechanisms of change. We then developed methods for direct identification of genes and regulatory motifs. The gene analysis yielded a major revision to the yeast gene catalogue, affecting approximately 15% of all genes and reducing the total count by about 500 genes. The motif analysis automatically identified 72 genome-wide elements, including most known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs. We inferred a putative function for most of these motifs, and provided insights into their combinatorial interactions. The results have implications for genome analysis of diverse organisms, including the human.'

abstract: 'As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at http://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.'

abstract: 'Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes that produce functional RNAs instead of encoding proteins seem to be somewhat more prevalent than previously thought. However, estimating their number and importance is difficult because systematic identification of ncRNA genes remains challenging. Here, we exploit a strong, surprising DNA composition bias in genomes of some hyperthermophilic organisms: simply screening for GC-rich regions in the AT-rich Methanococcus jannaschii and Pyrococcus furiosus genomes efficiently detects both known and new RNA genes with a high degree of secondary structure. A separate screen based on comparative analysis also successfully identifies noncoding RNA genes in P. furiosus. Nine of the 30 new candidate genes predicted by these screens have been verified to produce discrete, apparently noncoding transcripts with sizes ranging from 97 to 277 nucleotides.'

abstract: "BACKGROUND: For many RNA molecules, secondary structure rather than primary sequence is the evolutionarily conserved feature. No programs have yet been published that allow searching a sequence database for homologs of a single RNA molecule on the basis of secondary structure. RESULTS: We have developed a program, RSEARCH, that takes a single RNA sequence with its secondary structure and utilizes a local alignment algorithm to search a database for homologous RNAs. For this purpose, we have developed a series of base pair and single nucleotide substitution matrices for RNA sequences called RIBOSUM matrices. RSEARCH reports the statistical confidence for each hit as well as the structural alignment of the hit. We show several examples in which RSEARCH outperforms the primary sequence search programs BLAST and SSEARCH. The primary drawback of the program is that it is slow. The C code for RSEARCH is freely available from our lab's website. CONCLUSION: RSEARCH outperforms primary sequence programs in finding homologs of structured RNA sequences."

abstract: 'In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 encode 22- and 21-nucleotide (nt) RNAs, respectively, which function as key regulators of developmental timing. Because the appearance of these short RNAs is regulated during development, they are also referred to as small temporal RNAs (stRNAs). We show that many 21- and 22-nt expressed RNAs, termed microRNAs, exist in invertebrates and vertebrates and that some of these novel RNAs, similar to let-7 stRNA, are highly conserved. This suggests that sequence-specific, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by small RNAs are more general than previously appreciated.'

abstract: 'ERPIN is an RNA motif identification program that takes an RNA sequence alignment as an input and identifies related sequences using a profile-based dynamic programming algorithm. ERPIN differs from other RNA motif search programs in its ability to capture subtle biases in the training set and produce highly specific and sensitive searches, while keeping CPU requirements at a practical level. In its latest version, ERPIN also computes E-values, which tell biologists how likely they are to encounter a specific sequence match by chance-a useful indication of biological significance. We present here the ERPIN online search interface (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/erpin/). This web server automatically performs ERPIN searches for different RNA genes or motifs, using predefined training sets and search parameters. With a couple of clicks, users can analyze an entire bacterial genome or a genomic segment of up to 5Mb for the presence of tRNAs, 5S rRNAs, SRP RNA, C/D box snoRNAs, hammerhead motifs, miRNAs and other motifs. Search results are displayed with sequence, score, position, E-value and secondary structure graphics. An example of a complete genome scan is provided, as well as an evaluation of run times and specificity/sensitivity information for all available motifs.'

abstract: 'Two small temporal RNAs (stRNAs), lin-4 and let-7, control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that these two regulatory RNAs are members of a large class of 21- to 24-nucleotide noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We report on 55 previously unknown miRNAs in C. elegans. The miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development: a let-7 paralog is temporally coexpressed with let-7; miRNAs encoded in a single genomic cluster are coexpressed during embryogenesis; and still other miRNAs are expressed constitutively throughout development. Potential orthologs of several of these miRNA genes were identified in Drosophila and human genomes. The abundance of these tiny RNAs, their expression patterns, and their evolutionary conservation imply that, as a class, miRNAs have broad regulatory functions in animals.'

abstract: 'In recent years, natural antisense transcripts (NATs) have been implicated in many aspects of eukaryotic gene expression including genomic imprinting, RNA interference, translational regulation, alternative splicing, X-inactivation and RNA editing. Moreover, there is growing evidence to suggest that antisense transcription might have a key role in a range of human diseases. Consequently, there have been several recent attempts to identify novel NATs. To date, approximately 2500 mammalian NATs have been found, indicating that antisense transcription might be a common mechanism of regulating gene expression in human cells. There are increasingly diverse ways in which antisense transcription can regulate gene expression and evidence for the involvement of NATs in human disease is emerging. A range of bioinformatic resources could be used to assist future antisense research.'

abstract: 'Cis-acting elements in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression are often correlated with distinct local RNA secondary structure. These structures are expected to be significantly more ordered than those anticipated at random because of evolutionary constraints and intrinsic structural properties. In this study, we introduce a computing method to calculate two quantitative measures, NRd and Stscr, for estimating the uniqueness of an RNA secondary structure. NRd is a normalized score based on evaluating how different a natural RNA structure is from those predicted for its randomly shuffled variants. The lower the score NRd the more well ordered is the natural RNA structure. The statistical significance of NRd compared with that computed from structural comparisons among large numbers of randomly permuted sequences is represented by a standardized score, STSCR: We tested the method on the trans-activation response element and Rev response element of HIV-1 mRNA, internal ribosome entry sequence of hepatitis C virus, Tetrahymena thermophila rRNA intron, 100 tRNAs and 14 RNase P RNAs. Our data indicate that functional RNA structures have high Stscr, while other structures have low Stscr. We conclude that RNA functional molecules and/or cis-acting elements with structure dependent functions possess well ordered conformations and they are uniquely folded as measured by this technique.'

title: RNA molecules with structure dependent functions are uniquely folded.

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Growing evidence demonstrates that local well-ordered structures are closely correlated with cis-acting elements in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The prediction of a well-ordered folding sequence (WFS) in genomic sequences is very helpful in the determination of local RNA elements with structure-dependent functions in mRNAs. RESULTS: In this study, the quality of local WFS is assessed by the energy difference (E(diff)) between the free energies of the global minimal structure folded in the segment and its corresponding optimal restrained structure (ORS). The ORS is an optimal structure under the condition in which none of the base-pairs in the global minimal structure is allowed to form. Those WFSs in HIV-1 mRNA, various ferritin mRNAs and genomic sequences containing let-7 RNA gene were searched by a novel method, ed_scan. Our results indicate that the detected WFSs are coincident with known Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA, iron-responsive elements in ferritin mRNAs and small let-7 RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae and Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequences. Statistical significance of the WFS is addressed by a quantitative measure Zscr(e) that is a z-score of E(diff) and extensive random simulations. We suggest that WFSs with high statistical significance have structural roles involving their sequence information.

abstract: "We describe a program for the analysis of RNA secondary structure. There are two new features in this program. (i) To get vector speeds on a vector pipeline machine (such as Cray X-MP/24) we have vectorized the secondary structure dynamic algorithm. (ii) The statistical significance of a locally 'optimal' secondary structure is assessed by a Monte Carlo method. The results can be depicted graphically including profiles of the stability of local secondary structures and the distribution of the potentially significant secondary structures in the RNA molecules. Interesting regions where both the potentially significant secondary structures and 'open' structures (single-stranded coils) occur can be identified by the plots mentioned above. Furthermore, the speed of the vectorized code allows repeated Monte Carlo simulations with different overlapping window sizes. Thus, the optimal size of the significant secondary structure occurring in the interesting region can be assessed by repeating the Monte Carlo simulation. The power of the program is demonstrated in the analysis of local secondary structures of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type III (HIV)."

abstract: "RNA stem-loop structures situated just 3' to the frameshift sites of the retroviral gag-pol or gag-pro and pro-pol regions may make important contributions to frame-shifting in retroviruses. In this study, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of such secondary structural features relative to others in the sequence have been assessed using a newly developed method that combines calculations of the lowest free energy of formation of RNA secondary structures and the Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that stem-loop structures situated just 3' to the frameshift sites are both highly stable and statistically significant relative to others in the gag-pol or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains (both 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included) of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II), and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). No other more stable, or significant folding regions are predicted in these domains."

abstract: 'The lin-4 and let-7 antisense RNAs are temporal regulators that control the timing of developmental events in Caenorhabditis elegans by inhibiting translation of target mRNAs. let-7 RNA is conserved among bilaterian animals, suggesting that this class of small RNAs [microRNAs (miRNAs)] is evolutionarily ancient. Using bioinformatics and cDNA cloning, we found 15 new miRNA genes in C. elegans. Several of these genes express small transcripts that vary in abundance during C. elegans larval development, and three of them have apparent homologs in mammals and/or insects. Small noncoding RNAs of the miRNA class appear to be numerous and diverse.'

abstract: 'We describe a program, tRNAscan-SE, which identifies 99-100% of transfer RNA genes in DNA sequence while giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously described tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to identify candidate tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA covariance model. This work represents a practical application of RNA covariance models, which are general, probabilistic secondary structure profiles based on stochastic context-free grammars. tRNAscan-SE searches at approximately 30 000 bp/s. Additional extensions to tRNAscan-SE detect unusual tRNA homologues such as selenocysteine tRNAs, tRNA-derived repetitive elements and tRNA pseudogenes.'

abstract: "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are required for ribose 2'-O-methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Many of the genes for this snoRNA family have remained unidentified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, despite the availability of a complete genome sequence. Probabilistic modeling methods akin to those used in speech recognition and computational linguistics were used to computationally screen the yeast genome and identify 22 methylation guide snoRNAs, snR50 to snR71. Gene disruptions and other experimental characterization confirmed their methylation guide function. In total, 51 of the 55 ribose methylated sites in yeast ribosomal RNA were assigned to 41 different guide snoRNAs."

abstract: 'Although inhibition of RNA interference (RNAi) by plant virus proteins has been shown to enhance viral replication and pathogenesis in plants, no viral gene product has as yet been shown to inhibit RNAi in vertebrate cells. Here, we present evidence demonstrating that the highly structured approximately 160-nucleotide adenoviral VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit RNAi at physiological levels of expression. VA1, which is expressed at very high levels in adenovirus-infected cells, potently inhibited RNAi induced by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or human microRNA precursors but did not affect RNAi induced by artificial short interfering RNA duplexes. Inhibition appeared to be due both to inhibition of nuclear export of shRNA or premicro-RNA precursors, competition for the Exportin 5 nuclear export factor, and inhibition of Dicer function by direct binding of Dicer. Together, these data argue that adenovirus infection can result in inhibition of RNAi and identify VA1 RNA as the first viral gene product able to inhibit RNAi in human cells.'

abstract: 'RNA molecules fold into characteristic secondary and tertiary structures that account for their diverse functional activities. Many of these RNA structures are assembled from a collection of RNA structural motifs. These basic building blocks are used repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form different RNA types and define their unique structural and functional properties. Identification of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help associate elements of RNA structure with functional and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a computer program that can describe an RNA structural element of any complexity and then search any nucleotide sequence database, including the complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these structural elements. Here we describe in detail a new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif, and demonstrate its utility with some motif search examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search tools in two important aspects: first, the structure definition language is more flexible and can specify any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif provides a user controlled scoring section that can be used to add capabilities that patterns alone cannot provide.'

abstract: "Comparative sequence analysis has become an essential component of studies aiming to elucidate genome function. The increasing availability of genomic sequences from multiple vertebrates is creating the need for computational methods that can detect highly conserved regions in a robust fashion. Towards that end, we are developing approaches for identifying sequences that are conserved across multiple species; we call these &quot;Multi-species Conserved Sequences&quot; (or MCSs). Here we report two strategies for MCS identification, demonstrating their ability to detect virtually all known actively conserved sequences (specifically, coding sequences) but very little neutrally evolving sequence (specifically, ancestral repeats). Importantly, we find that a substantial fraction of the bases within MCSs (approximately 70%) resides within non-coding regions; thus, the majority of sequences conserved across multiple vertebrate species has no known function. Initial characterization of these MCSs has revealed sequences that correspond to clusters of transcription factor-binding sites, non-coding RNA transcripts, and other candidate functional elements. Finally, the ability to detect MCSs represents a valuable metric for assessing the relative contribution of a species' sequence to identifying genomic regions of interest, and our results indicate that the currently available genome sequences are insufficient for the comprehensive identification of MCSs in the human genome."

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Genomes from all organisms known to date express two types of RNA molecules: messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are translated into proteins, and non-messenger RNAs, which function at the RNA level and do not serve as templates for translation. RESULTS: We have generated a specialized cDNA library from Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the population of small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) sized 50-500 nt in a plant. From this library, we identified 140 candidates for novel snmRNAs and investigated their expression, abundance, and developmental regulation. Based on conserved sequence and structure motifs, 104 snmRNA species can be assigned to novel members of known classes of RNAs (designated Class I snmRNAs), namely, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 7SL RNA, U snRNAs, as well as a tRNA-like RNA. For the first time, 39 novel members of H/ACA box snoRNAs could be identified in a plant species. Of the remaining 36 snmRNA candidates (designated Class II snmRNAs), no sequence or structure motifs were present that would enable an assignment to a known class of RNAs. These RNAs were classified based on their location on the A. thaliana genome. From these, 29 snmRNA species located to intergenic regions, 3 located to intronic sequences of protein coding genes, and 4 snmRNA candidates were derived from annotated open reading frames. Surprisingly, 15 of the Class II snmRNA candidates were shown to be tissue-specifically expressed, while 12 are encoded by the mitochondrial or chloroplast genome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified 140 novel candidates for small non-messenger RNA species in the plant A. thaliana and thereby sets the stage for their functional analysis.'

abstract: 'A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3% to 86.8% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67% to 76%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with &lt;40% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28% to 78%. For the 11 sequences with &lt;6% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84% of known canonical base pairs.'

abstract: 'An improved dynamic programming algorithm is reported for RNA secondary structure prediction by free energy minimization. Thermodynamic parameters for the stabilities of secondary structure motifs are revised to include expanded sequence dependence as revealed by recent experiments. Additional algorithmic improvements include reduced search time and storage for multibranch loop free energies and improved imposition of folding constraints. An extended database of 151,503 nt in 955 structures? determined by comparative sequence analysis was assembled to allow optimization of parameters not based on experiments and to test the accuracy of the algorithm. On average, the predicted lowest free energy structure contains 73 % of known base-pairs when domains of fewer than 700 nt are folded; this compares with 64 % accuracy for previous versions of the algorithm and parameters. For a given sequence, a set of 750 generated structures contains one structure that, on average, has 86 % of known base-pairs. Experimental constraints, derived from enzymatic and flavin mononucleotide cleavage, improve the accuracy of structure predictions.'

abstract: 'Around 98% of all transcriptional output in humans is non-coding RNA. RNA-mediated gene regulation is widespread in higher eukaryotes and complex genetic phenomena like RNA interference, co-suppression, transgene silencing, imprinting, methylation, and possibly position-effect variegation and transvection, all involve intersecting pathways based on or connected to RNA signaling. I suggest that the central dogma is incomplete, and that intronic and other non-coding RNAs have evolved to comprise a second tier of gene expression in eukaryotes, which enables the integration and networking of complex suites of gene activity. Although proteins are the fundamental effectors of cellular function, the basis of eukaryotic complexity and phenotypic variation may lie primarily in a control architecture composed of a highly parallel system of trans-acting RNAs that relay state information required for the coordination and modulation of gene expression, via chromatin remodeling, RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. This system has interesting and perhaps informative analogies with small world networks and dataflow computing.'

abstract: 'The central dogma of biology holds that genetic information normally flows from DNA to RNA to protein. As a consequence it has been generally assumed that genes generally code for proteins, and that proteins fulfil not only most structural and catalytic but also most regulatory functions, in all cells, from microbes to mammals. However, the latter may not be the case in complex organisms. A number of startling observations about the extent of non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcription in the higher eukaryotes and the range of genetic and epigenetic phenomena that are RNA-directed suggests that the traditional view of the structure of genetic regulatory systems in animals and plants may be incorrect. ncRNA dominates the genomic output of the higher organisms and has been shown to control chromosome architecture, mRNA turnover and the developmental timing of protein expression, and may also regulate transcription and alternative splicing. This paper re-examines the available evidence and suggests a new framework for considering and understanding the genomic programming of biological complexity, autopoietic development and phenotypic variation.'

abstract: 'The Escherichia coli K-12 genome (ECO) was compared with the sampled genomes of the sibling species Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi A (collectively referred to as SAL) and the genome of the close outgroup Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN). There are at least 160 locations where sequences of &gt;400 bp are absent from ECO but present in the genomes of all three SAL and 394 locations where sequences are present in ECO but close homologs are absent in all SAL genomes. The 394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL contain 1350 (30.6%) of the 4405 ECO genes. Of these, 1165 are missing from both SAL and KPN. Most of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of such genes. Among these regions were six that included previously identified cryptic phage. A hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that differ between ECO and SAL can be inferred in some cases by reference to the genome structure in KPN and the more distant relative Yersinia pestis. However, many changes between ECO and SAL are concentrated in regions where all four genera have a different structure. The rate of gene insertion and deletion is sufficiently high in these regions that the ancestral state of the ECO/SAL lineage cannot be inferred from the present data. The sequencing of other closely related genomes, such as S.bongori or Citrobacter, may help in this regard.'

abstract: 'The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.'

abstract: "Aptamers are artificial nucleic acids that selectively bind small molecules. In the past two years, it has become clear that nature has already devised its own aptamers that play important regulatory roles. RNA sensors have been discovered in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that function as molecular switches in response to direct binding of structurally diverse metabolites. These natural RNA aptamers, called 'riboswitches', are imbedded in the leader sequences of numerous metabolic genes. Riboswitches are able to repress or activate their cognate genes at both transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we summarize the recent progress in the identification and characterization of riboswitches and discuss their evolution and distribution."

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 to approximately 25-nucleotides (nt) long and interact with mRNAs to trigger either translational repression or RNA cleavage through RNA interference (RNAi), depending on the degree of complementarity with the target mRNAs. Our recent study has shown that HIV-1 nef dsRNA from AIDS patients who are long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) inhibited the transcription of HIV-1. RESULTS: Here, we show the possibility that nef-derived miRNAs are produced in HIV-1 persistently infected cells. Furthermore, nef short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that corresponded to a predicted nef miRNA (approximately 25 nt, miR-N367) can block HIV-1 Nef expression in vitro and the suppression by shRNA/miR-N367 would be related with low viremia in an LTNP (15-2-2). In the 15-2-2 model mice, the weight loss, which may be rendered by nef was also inhibited by shRNA/miR-N367 corresponding to suppression of nef expression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nef/U3 miRNAs produced in HIV-1-infected cells may suppress both Nef function and HIV-1 virulence through the RNAi pathway.'

abstract: 'Considering the intense genetic efforts applied to understanding development, it is surprising that a relatively large class of regulatory genes has newly surfaced. The first microRNA gene and its developmental role were described more than ten years ago, but only recently have we fully appreciated the broad and abundant presence of such genes. MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide RNAs that use antisense complementarity to inhibit expression of specific mRNAs. Recent studies of restricted expression patterns and functional roles have implicated specific microRNAs in complex genetic pathways regulating embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, neuronal differentiation and Hox-mediated development.'

abstract: 'The recent interest sparked due to the discovery of a variety of functions for non-coding RNA molecules has highlighted the need for suitable tools for the analysis and the comparison of RNA sequences. Many trans-acting non-coding RNA genes and cis-acting RNA regulatory elements present motifs, conserved both in structure and sequence, that can be hardly detected by primary sequence analysis alone. We present an algorithm that takes as input a set of unaligned RNA sequences expected to share a common motif, and outputs the regions that are most conserved throughout the sequences, according to a similarity measure that takes into account both the sequence of the regions and the secondary structure they can form according to base-pairing and thermodynamic rules. Only a single parameter is needed as input, which denotes the number of distinct hairpins the motif has to contain. No further constraints on the size, number and position of the single elements comprising the motif are required. The algorithm can be split into two parts: first, it extracts from each input sequence a set of candidate regions whose predicted optimal secondary structure contains the number of hairpins given as input. Then, the regions selected are compared with each other to find the groups of most similar ones, formed by a region taken from each sequence. To avoid exhaustive enumeration of the search space and to reduce the execution time, a greedy heuristic is introduced for this task. We present different experiments, which show that the algorithm is capable of characterizing and discovering known regulatory motifs in mRNA like the iron responsive element (IRE) and selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) stem-loop structures. We also show how it can be applied to corrupted datasets in which a motif does not appear in all the input sequences, as well as to the discovery of more complex motifs in the non-coding RNA.'

abstract: "The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (5'- and 3'-UTRs) of eukaryotic mRNAs are known to play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression modulating nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization and stability. UTRdb is a specialized database of 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. All these patterns have been collected in the UTRsite database so that it is possible to search any input sequence for the presence of annotated functional motifs. Furthermore, UTRdb entries have been annotated for the presence of repetitive elements. All Internet resources we implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5'- and 3'-UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/BIG/UTRHome/."

abstract: 'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4), a member of the human herpesvirus (HHV) family, has recently been shown to encode microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast to most eukaryotic miRNAs, these viral miRNAs do not have close homologs in other viral genomes or in the genome of the human host. To identify other miRNA genes in pathogenic viruses, we combined a new miRNA gene prediction method with small-RNA cloning from several virus-infected cell types. We cloned ten miRNAs in the Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV or HHV8), nine miRNAs in the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and nine miRNAs in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV5). These miRNA genes are expressed individually or in clusters from either polymerase (pol) II or pol III promoters, and share no substantial sequence homology with one another or with the known human miRNAs. Generally, we predicted miRNAs in several large DNA viruses, and we could neither predict nor experimentally identify miRNAs in the genomes of small RNA viruses or retroviruses.'

We report here the genome sequence of the Brown Norway (BN) rat strain. The sequence represents a high-quality 'draft' covering over 90% of the genome. The BN rat sequence is the third complete mammalian genome to be deciphered, and three-way comparisons with the human and mouse genomes resolve details of mammalian evolution. This first comprehensive analysis includes genes and proteins and their relation to human disease, repeated sequences, comparative genome-wide studies of mammalian orthologous chromosomal regions and rearrangement breakpoints, reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes and the events leading to existing species, rates of variation, and lineage-specific and lineage-independent evolutionary events such as expansion of gene families, orthology relations and protein evolution."

abstract: 'We describe a method for prediction of genes that encode the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP). A heuristic search for the strongly conserved helix 8 motif of SRP RNA is combined with covariance models that are based on previously known SRP RNA sequences. By screening available genomic sequences we have identified a large number of novel SRP RNA genes and we can account for at least one gene in every genome that has been completely sequenced. Novel bacterial RNAs include that of Thermotoga maritima, which, unlike all other non-gram-positive eubacteria, is predicted to have an Alu domain. We have also found the RNAs of Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus to have an unusual UGAC tetraloop in helix 8 instead of the normal GNRA sequence. An investigation of yeast RNAs reveals conserved sequence elements of the Alu domain that aid in the analysis of these RNAs. Analysis of the human genome reveals only two likely genes, both on chromosome 14. Our method for SRP RNA gene prediction is the first convenient tool for this task and should be useful in genome annotation.'

abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Several results in the literature suggest that biologically interesting RNAs have secondary structures that are more stable than expected by chance. Based on these observations, we developed a scanning algorithm for detecting noncoding RNA genes in genome sequences, using a fully probabilistic version of the Zuker minimum-energy folding algorithm. RESULTS: Preliminary results were encouraging, but certain anomalies led us to do a carefully controlled investigation of this class of methods. Ultimately, our results argue that for the probabilistic model there is indeed a statistical effect, but it comes mostly from local base-composition bias and not from RNA secondary structure. For the thermodynamic implementation (which evaluates statistical significance by doing Monte Carlo shuffling in fixed-length sequence windows, thus eliminating the base-composition effect) the signals for noncoding RNAs are still usually indistinguishable from noise, especially when certain statistical artifacts resulting from local base-composition inhomogeneity are taken into account. We conclude that although a distinct, stable secondary structure is undoubtedly important in most noncoding RNAs, the stability of most noncoding RNA secondary structures is not sufficiently different from the predicted stability of a random sequence to be useful as a general genefinding approach.'

abstract: 'Some genes produce noncoding transcripts that function directly as structural, regulatory, or even catalytic RNAs [1, 2]. Unlike protein-coding genes, which can be detected as open reading frames with distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene sequences have no obvious inherent statistical biases [3]. Thus, genome sequence analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes, but any novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we describe a computational comparative genomic screen for ncRNA genes. The key idea is to distinguish conserved RNA secondary structures from a background of other conserved sequences using probabilistic models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise sequence alignments. We report the first whole-genome screen for ncRNA genes done with this method, in which we applied it to the &quot;intergenic&quot; spacers of Escherichia coli using comparative sequence data from four related bacteria. Starting from &gt;23,000 conserved interspecies pairwise alignments, the screen predicted 275 candidate structural RNA loci. A sample of 49 candidate loci was assayed experimentally. At least 11 loci expressed small, apparently noncoding RNA transcripts of unknown function. Our computational approach may be used to discover structural ncRNA genes in any genome for which appropriate comparative genome sequence data are available.'

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts that exert their function without ever producing proteins. Noncoding RNA gene sequences do not have strong statistical signals, unlike protein coding genes. A reliable general purpose computational genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural RNA genes. The key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions observed in a pairwise alignment of two homologous sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved structural RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We formalize this intuition using three probabilistic &quot;pair-grammars&quot;: a pair stochastic context free grammar modeling alignments constrained by structural RNA evolution, a pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments constrained by coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. from a BLASTN comparison of two related genomes) we classify the alignment into the coding, RNA, or null class according to the posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We have implemented this approach as a program, QRNA, which we consider to be a prototype structural noncoding RNA genefinder. Tests suggest that this approach detects noncoding RNA genes with a fair degree of reliability.'

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Probabilistic models for sequence comparison (such as hidden Markov models and pair hidden Markov models for proteins and mRNAs, or their context-free grammar counterparts for structural RNAs) often assume a fixed degree of divergence. Ideally we would like these models to be conditional on evolutionary divergence time. Probabilistic models of substitution events are well established, but there has not been a completely satisfactory theoretical framework for modeling insertion and deletion events. RESULTS: I have developed a method for extending standard Markov substitution models to include gap characters, and another method for the evolution of state transition probabilities in a probabilistic model. These methods use instantaneous rate matrices in a way that is more general than those used for substitution processes, and are sufficient to provide time-dependent models for standard linear and affine gap penalties, respectively. Given a probabilistic model, we can make all of its emission probabilities (including gap characters) and all its transition probabilities conditional on a chosen divergence time. To do this, we only need to know the parameters of the model at one particular divergence time instance, as well as the parameters of the model at the two extremes of zero and infinite divergence. I have implemented these methods in a new generation of the RNA genefinder QRNA (eQRNA). CONCLUSION: These methods can be applied to incorporate evolutionary models of insertions and deletions into any hidden Markov model or stochastic context-free grammar, in a pair or profile form, for sequence modeling.'

Additional data are provided for polypeptides with established or potential roles in SRP-mediated protein targeting, such as the beta subunit of SRP receptor, Flhf, Hbsu and cpSRP43. Also available are motifs for the identification of new SRP RNA sequences, 2D representations, three-dimensional models in PDB format, and links to the high-resolution structures of several SRP components. New to this version of SRPDB is the introduction of a relational database system and a SRP RNA prediction server (SRP-Scan) which allows the identification of SRP RNAs within genome sequences and also generates secondary structure diagrams.'

abstract: 'In some animals, including mammals, a number of genes are expressed differently according to whether they have been inherited from the mother or from the father, through a process known as genomic imprinting. Noncoding RNAs have increasingly been found associated with imprinted genes, but their role, if any, has remained enigmatic. A recent study provides the first evidence that, at least in one case, a noncoding RNA has a direct role in regulating imprinted gene expression in cis.'

abstract: "The hypothesis that genomic regions rich in non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be identified using local variations in single-base and dinucleotide statistics has been investigated. (G+C)%, (G-C)% difference, (A-T)% difference and dinucleotide-frequency statistics were compared among seven classes of ncRNAs and three genomes. Significant variations were observed in (G+C)% and, in Methanococcus jannaschii, in the frequency of the dinucleotide 'CG'. Screening programs based on these two base-composition statistics were developed. With (G+C)% screening alone, a 1% fraction of the M.jannaschii genome containing all 44 known transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and signal recognition particle RNAs could be identified. When (G+C)% combined with CG dinucleotide-frequency screening was used, 43 of the 44 known M.jannaschii structural ncRNAs were again identified, while the number of presumably false hits overlapping a known or putative protein-coding gene was reduced from 15 to 6. In addition, 19 candidate ncRNAs were identified including one with significant homology to several known archaeal RNaseP RNAs."

abstract: 'One of the largest families of small RNAs in eukaryotes is the H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), most of which guide RNA pseudouridine formation. So far, an effective computational method specifically for identifying H/ACA snoRNA gene sequences has not been established. We have developed snoGPS, a program for computationally screening genomic sequences for H/ACA guide snoRNAs. The program implements a deterministic screening algorithm combined with a probabilistic model to score gene candidates. We report here the results of testing snoGPS on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Six candidate snoRNAs were verified as novel RNA transcripts, and five of these were verified as guides for pseudouridine formation at specific sites in ribosomal RNA. We also predicted 14 new base-pairings between snoRNAs and known pseudouridine sites in S.cerevisiae rRNA, 12 of which were verified by gene disruption and loss of the cognate pseudouridine site. Our findings include the first prediction and verification of snoRNAs that guide pseudouridine modification at more than two sites. With this work, 41 of the 44 known pseudouridine modifications in S.cerevisiae rRNA have been linked with a verified snoRNA, providing the most complete accounting of the H/ACA snoRNAs that guide pseudouridylation in any species.'

abstract: 'In addition to characteristic structural properties imposed by evolutionary modification, evolved, single-stranded RNAs also display characteristic structural properties imposed by intrinsic physical constraints on RNA polymer folding. The balance of intrinsic and functionally selected characters in the folded conformation of evolved secondary structures was determined by comparing the predicted secondary structures of evolved and unevolved (random) RNA sequences. Though evolved conformations are significantly more ordered than conformations of random-sequence RNA, this analysis demonstrates that the majority of conformational order within evolved structures results not from evolutionary optimization but from constraints imposed by rules intrinsic to RNA polymer folding.'

abstract: "RNA folding is viewed here as a map assigning secondary structures to sequences. At fixed chain length the number of sequences far exceeds the number of structures. Frequencies of structures are highly non-uniform and follow a generalized form of Zipf's law: we find relatively few common and many rare ones. By using an algorithm for inverse folding, we show that sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly over sequence space. All common structures can be accessed from an arbitrary sequence by a number of mutations much smaller than the chain length. The sequence space is percolated by extensive neutral networks connecting nearest neighbours folding into identical structures. Implications for evolutionary adaptation and for applied molecular evolution are evident: finding a particular structure by mutation and selection is much simpler than expected and, even if catalytic activity should turn out to be sparse of RNA structures, it can hardly be missed by evolutionary processes."

abstract: 'Analysis of multiple sequence alignments can generate important, testable hypotheses about the phylogenetic history and cellular function of genomic sequences. We describe the MultiPipMaker server, which aligns multiple, long genomic DNA sequences quickly and with good sensitivity (available at http://bio.cse.psu.edu/ since May 2001). Alignments are computed between a contiguous reference sequence and one or more secondary sequences, which can be finished or draft sequence. The outputs include a stacked set of percent identity plots, called a MultiPip, comparing the reference sequence with subsequent sequences, and a nucleotide-level multiple alignment. New tools are provided to search MultiPipMaker output for conserved matches to a user-specified pattern and for conserved matches to position weight matrices that describe transcription factor binding sites (singly and in clusters). We illustrate the use of MultiPipMaker to identify candidate regulatory regions in WNT2 and then demonstrate by transfection assays that they are functional. Analysis of the alignments also confirms the phylogenetic inference that horses are more closely related to cats than to cows.'

abstract: 'We aligned and analyzed 100 pairs of complete, orthologous intergenic regions from the human and mouse genomes (average length approximately 12 000 nucleotides). The alignments alternate between highly similar segments and dissimilar segments, indicating a wide variation of selective constraint. The average number of selectively constrained nucleotides within a mammalian intergenic region is at least 2000. This is threefold higher than within a nematode intergenic region and at least twofold higher than the number of selectively constrained nucleotides coding for an average protein. Because mammals possess only two- to threefold more proteins than Caenorhabditis elegans, the higher complexity of mammals might be primarily because of the functioning of intergenic DNA.'

abstract: 'Similarity between related genomes may carry information on selective constraint in each of them. We analysed patterns of similarity between several homologous regions of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae genomes. All homologous exons are quite similar. Alignments of introns and of intergenic sequences contain long gaps, segments where similarity is low and close to that between random sequences aligned using the same parameters, and segments of high similarity. Conservative estimates of the fractions of selectively constrained nucleotides are 72%, 17% and 18% for exons, introns and intergenic sequences, respectively. This implies that the total number of constrained nucleotides within non-coding sequences is comparable to that within coding sequences, so that at least one-third of nucleotides in C. elegans and C. briggsae genomes are under strong stabilizing selection.'

abstract: "We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3%-8% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37%-53%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18%-37%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47%-68%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure."

abstract: "In this article, we show that a subset of conventional mammalian microRNAs is derived from LINE-2 transposable elements and other genome repeats. These repeat-derived microRNAs arise from conventional precursor hairpins and are distinct from the rasiRNAs, which appear to be processed from long double-stranded RNA precursors. The insertion of transposable elements into new genomic sites appears to be one of the driving-forces that create new microRNAs during mammalian evolution. Two of the LINE-2-derived microRNAs exhibit perfect complementarity to a large family of mRNA and EST transcripts that contain portions of MIR and other LINE-2 elements in their 3'-untranslated regions."

abstract: 'The soil nematodes Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans diverged from a common ancestor roughly 100 million years ago and yet are almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes.'

abstract: 'Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been found to have roles in a great variety of processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromosome replication, RNA processing and modification, messenger RNA stability and translation, and even protein degradation and translocation. Recent studies indicate that ncRNAs are far more abundant and important than initially imagined. These findings raise several fundamental questions: How many ncRNAs are encoded by a genome? Given the absence of a diagnostic open reading frame, how can these genes be identified? How can all the functions of ncRNAs be elucidated?'

abstract: 'Two classes of short RNA molecule, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been identified as sequence-specific posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. siRNA and miRNA are incorporated into related RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), termed siRISC and miRISC, respectively. The current model argues that siRISC and miRISC are functionally interchangeable and target specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression, depending on the extent of sequence complementarity between the small RNA and its target. Emerging evidence indicates, however, that siRISC and miRISC are distinct complexes that regulate mRNA stability and translation. The assembly of RISCs can be traced from the biogenesis of the small RNA molecules and the recruitment of these RNAs by the RISC loading complex (RLC) to the transition of the RLC into the active RISC. Target recognition by the RISC can then take place through different interacting modes.'

abstract: 'The systematic comparison of genomic sequences from different organisms represents a central focus of contemporary genome analysis. Comparative analyses of vertebrate sequences can identify coding and conserved non-coding regions, including regulatory elements, and provide insight into the forces that have rendered modern-day genomes. As a complement to whole-genome sequencing efforts, we are sequencing and comparing targeted genomic regions in multiple, evolutionarily diverse vertebrates. Here we report the generation and analysis of over 12 megabases (Mb) of sequence from 12 species, all derived from the genomic region orthologous to a segment of about 1.8 Mb on human chromosome 7 containing ten genes, including the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis. These sequences show conservation reflecting both functional constraints and the neutral mutational events that shaped this genomic region. In particular, we identify substantial numbers of conserved non-coding segments beyond those previously identified experimentally, most of which are not detectable by pair-wise sequence comparisons alone. Analysis of transposable element insertions highlights the variation in genome dynamics among these species and confirms the placement of rodents as a sister group to the primates.'

abstract: 'The sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.'

abstract: 'MCS4 RNA is one of the small stable RNAs found in Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum type strain California kid. This RNA has a sequence similarity to that of eukaryotic U6 snRNA. There are two genes encoding MCS4 RNA, designated mcs4a and mcs4b, in the genome. Homologous sequences of these genes were not found in databases of other bacterial sequences. We searched for MCS4 RNA and its genes in other bacteria by PCR and hybridization techniques. The results strongly suggested that this RNA exists only in a limited species of mycoplasmas belonging to the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster.'

abstract: "An RNA model system consisting of an oligomer binding to a 4-nt overhang at the 5' end of a hairpin stem provides thermodynamic parameters for helix-helix interfaces. In a sequence-dependent manner, oligomers bind up to 1000-fold more tightly adjacent to the hairpin stem than predicted for binding to a free tetramer at 37 degrees C. For the interface (/) in [formula: see text] additional free energy change, delta delta G 37 degrees, for binding is roughly the nearest-neighbor delta G 37 degrees for propagation of an uninterrupted helix of equivalent sequence, CGGC. When X and Z are omitted, the delta delta 37 degrees is even more favorable by approximately 1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184J). On average, predictions of 11 RNA secondary structures improve from 67 to 74% accuracy by inclusion of similar stacking contributions."

abstract: "BACKGROUND: The genome of the avian adenovirus Chicken Embryo Lethal Orphan (CELO) has two terminal regions without detectable homology in mammalian adenoviruses that are left without annotation in the initial analysis. Since adenoviruses have been a rich source of new insights into molecular cell biology and practical applications of CELO as gene a delivery vector are being considered, this genome appeared worth revisiting. We conducted a systematic reannotation and in-depth sequence analysis of the CELO genome. RESULTS: We describe a strongly diverged paralogous cluster including ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13, and ORF-14 with an ATPase/helicase domain most likely acquired from adeno-associated parvoviruses. None of these ORFs appear to have retained ATPase/helicase function and alternative functions (e.g. modulation of gene expression during the early life-cycle) must be considered in an adenoviral context. Further, we identified a cluster of three putative type-1-transmembrane glycoproteins with IG-like domains (ORF-9, ORF-10, ORF-11) which are good candidates to substitute for the missing immunomodulatory functions of mammalian adenoviruses. ORF-16 (located directly adjacent) displays distant homology to vertebrate mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. Members of this family are known to be involved in immuno-regulation and similiar functions during CELO life cycle can be considered for this ORF. Finally, we describe a putative triglyceride lipase (merged ORF-18/19) with additional domains, which can be expected to have specific roles during the infection of birds, since they are unique to avian adenoviruses and Marek's disease-like viruses, a group of pathogenic avian herpesviruses. CONCLUSIONS: We could characterize most of the previously unassigned ORFs pointing to functions in host-virus interaction. The results provide new directives for rationally designed experiments."

abstract: 'Facing the ever-growing list of newly discovered classes of functional RNAs, it can be expected that further types of functional RNAs are still hidden in recently completed genomes. The computational identification of such RNA genes is, therefore, of major importance. While most known functional RNAs have characteristic secondary structures, their free energies are generally not statistically significant enough to distinguish RNA genes from the genomic background. Additional information is required. Considering the wide availability of new genomic data of closely related species, comparative studies seem to be the most promising approach. Here, we show that prediction of consensus structures of aligned sequences can be a significant measure to detect functional RNAs. We report a new method to test multiple sequence alignments for the existence of an unusually structured and conserved fold. We show for alignments of six types of well-known functional RNA that an energy score consisting of free energy and a covariation term significantly improves sensitivity compared to single sequence predictions. We further test our method on a number of non-coding RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans/Caenorhabditis briggsae and seven Saccharomyces species. Most RNAs can be detected with high significance. We provide a Perl implementation that can be used readily to score single alignments and discuss how the methods described here can be extended to allow for efficient genome-wide screens.'

abstract: 'Conservation of microRNAs (miRNAs) among species suggests that they bear conserved biological functions. However, sequencing of new miRNAs has not always been accompanied by a search for orthologues in other species. I report herein the results of a systematic search for interspecies orthologues of miRNA precursors, leading to the identification of 35 human and 45 mouse new putative miRNA genes. MicroRNA tracks were written to visualize miRNAs in human and mouse genomes on the UCSC Genome Browser. Based on their localization, miRNA precursors can be excised either from introns or exons of mRNAs. When intronic miRNAs are antisense to the apparent host gene, they appear to originate from ill-characterized antisense transcription units. Exonic miRNAs are, in general, nonprotein-coding, poorly conserved genes in sense orientation. In three cases, the excision of an miRNA from a protein-coding mRNA might lead to the degradation of the rest of the transcript. Moreover, three new examples of miRNAs fully complementary to an mRNA are reported. Among these, miR135a might control the stability and/or translation of an alternative form of the glycerate kinase mRNA by RNA interference. I also discuss the presence of human miRNAs in introns of paralogous genes and in miRNA clusters.'

abstract: "MOTIVATION: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)-functional RNA molecules not coding for proteins-are grouped into hundreds of families of homologs. To find new members of an ncRNA gene family in a large genome database, covariance models (CMs) are a useful statistical tool, as they use both sequence and RNA secondary structure information. Unfortunately, CM searches are slow. Previously, we introduced 'rigorous filters', which provably sacrifice none of CMs' accuracy, although often scanning much faster. A rigorous filter, using a profile hidden Markov model (HMM), is built based on the CM, and filters the genome database, eliminating sequences that provably could not be annotated as homologs. The CM is run only on the remainder. Some biologically important ncRNA families could not be scanned efficiently with this technique, largely due to the significance of conserved secondary structure relative to primary sequence in identifying these families. Current heuristic filters are also expected to perform poorly on such families. RESULTS: By augmenting profile HMMs with limited secondary structure information, we obtain rigorous filters that accelerate CM searches for virtually all known ncRNA families from the Rfam Database and tRNA models in tRNAscan-SE. These filters scan an 8 gigabase database in weeks instead of years, and uncover homologs missed by heuristic techniques to speed CM searches.

abstract: 'This work investigates whether mRNA has a lower estimated folding free energy than random sequences. The free energy estimates are calculated by the mfold program for prediction of RNA secondary structures. For a set of 46 mRNAs it is shown that the predicted free energy is not significantly different from random sequences with the same dinucleotide distribution. For random sequences with the same mononucleotide distribution it has previously been shown that the native mRNA sequences have a lower predicted free energy, which indicates a more stable structure than random sequences. However, dinucleotide content is important when assessing the significance of predicted free energy as the physical stability of RNA secondary structure is known to depend on dinucleotide base stacking energies. Even known RNA secondary structures, like tRNAs, can be shown to have predicted free energies indistinguishable from randomized sequences. This suggests that the predicted free energy is not always a good determinant for RNA folding.'

abstract: 'An algorithm is presented for generating rigorously all suboptimal secondary structures between the minimum free energy and an arbitrary upper limit. The algorithm is particularly fast in the vicinity of the minimum free energy. This enables the efficient approximation of statistical quantities, such as the partition function or measures for structural diversity. The density of states at low energies and its associated structures are crucial in assessing from a thermodynamic point of view how well-defined the ground state is. We demonstrate this by exploring the role of base modification in tRNA secondary structures, both at the level of individual sequences from Escherichia coli and by comparing artificially generated ensembles of modified and unmodified sequences with the same tRNA structure. The two major conclusions are that (1) base modification considerably sharpens the definition of the ground state structure by constraining energetically adjacent structures to be similar to the ground state, and (2) sequences whose ground state structure is thermodynamically well defined show a significant tendency to buffer single point mutations. This can have evolutionary implications, since selection pressure to improve the definition of ground states with biological function may result in increased neutrality.'

abstract: 'Improved thermodynamic parameters for prediction of RNA duplex formation are derived from optical melting studies of 90 oligoribonucleotide duplexes containing only Watson-Crick base pairs. To test end or base composition effects, new sets of duplexes are included that have identical nearest neighbors, but different base compositions and therefore different ends. Duplexes with terminal GC pairs are more stable than duplexes with the same nearest neighbors but terminal AU pairs. Penalizing terminal AU base pairs by 0.45 kcal/mol relative to terminal GC base pairs significantly improves predictions of DeltaG degrees37 from a nearest-neighbor model. A physical model is suggested in which the differential treatment of AU and GC ends accounts for the dependence of the total number of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds on the base composition of a duplex. On average, the new parameters predict DeltaG degrees37, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS degrees, and TM within 3.2%, 6.0%, 6.8%, and 1.3 degreesC, respectively. These predictions are within the limit of the model, based on experimental results for duplexes predicted to have identical thermodynamic parameters.'

abstract: "We have earlier generated a mutant mouse in a course of making a transgenic line that exhibited interesting heterozygote phenotypes, which exhibited failure to thrive, severe bone deformities, and polycystic kidneys. This mutant mouse provided a clue to uncover a unique role of expressed pseudogenes. In this mutant the transgene was integrated into the vicinity of the expressing pseudogene of Makorin1 called Makorin1-p1. This insertion reduced transcription of the Makorin1-p1, resulting in destabilization of the Makorin1 mRNA in trans via a cis-acting RNA decay element within the 5' region of Makorin1 that is homologous between Makorin1 and Makorin1-p1. These findings demonstrate a novel and specific regulatory role of an expressed pseudogene as well as functional significance for noncoding RNAs. Next, we developed an original algorithm to determine how many pseudogenes are expressed. Based on our examination 2-3% of human processed pseudogenes are expressed using the most strict criteria. Interestingly, the mouse has a much smaller proportion of expressed pseudogenes (0.5-1%). Pseudogenes are functionally less constrained, and have accumulated more mutations than translated genes. If they have some functions in gene regulation, this property would allow more rapid functional diversification than protein-coding genes. In addition, some genetic phenomena that exhibit incomplete penetrance might be attributed to &quot;mutation&quot; or &quot;variation&quot; of pseudogenes."

abstract: "By generating a specialised cDNA library from four different developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster, we have identified 66 candidates for small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) and have confirmed their expression by northern blot analysis. Thirteen of them were expressed at certain stages of D.melanogaster development, only. Thirty-five species belong to the class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), divided into 15 members from the C/D subclass and 20 members from the H/ACA subclass, which mostly guide 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively, of rRNA and snRNAs. These also include two outstanding C/D snoRNAs, U3 and U14, both functioning as pre-rRNA chaperones. Surprisingly, the sequence of the Drosophila U14 snoRNA reflects a major change of function of this snoRNA in Diptera relative to yeast and vertebrates. Among the 22 snmRNAs lacking known sequence and structure motifs, five were located in intergenic regions, two in introns, five in untranslated regions of mRNAs, eight were derived from open reading frames, and two were transcribed opposite to an intron. Interestingly, detection of two RNA species from this group implies that certain snmRNA species are processed from alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs. Surprisingly, a few snmRNA sequences could not be found on the published D.melanogaster genome, which might suggest that more snmRNA genes (as well as mRNAs) are hidden in unsequenced regions of the genome."

abstract: "The abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely related software applications available on the World Wide Web (WWW) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. The objective of this web server is to provide easy access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. Detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. A variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. This URL will be referred to as 'MFOLDROOT'."

abstract: 'This paper presents a new computer method for folding an RNA molecule that finds a conformation of minimum free energy using published values of stacking and destabilizing energies. It is based on a dynamic programming algorithm from applied mathematics, and is much more efficient, faster, and can fold larger molecules than procedures which have appeared up to now in the biological literature. Its power is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain messenger RNA fragment. We go beyond the basic method to show how to incorporate additional information into the algorithm. This includes data on chemical reactivity and enzyme susceptibility. We illustrate this with the folding of two large fragments from the 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli.'

abstract: 'An algorithm and a computer program have been prepared for determining RNA secondary structures within any prescribed increment of the computed global minimum free energy. The mathematical problem of determining how well defined a minimum energy folding is can now be solved. All predicted base pairs that can participate in suboptimal structures may be displayed and analyzed graphically. Representative suboptimal foldings are generated by selecting these base pairs one at a time and computing the best foldings that contain them. A distance criterion that ensures that no two structures are &quot;too close&quot; is used to avoid multiple generation of similar structures. Thermodynamic parameters, including free-energy increments for single-base stacking at the ends of helices and for terminal mismatched pairs in interior and hairpin loops, are incorporated into the underlying folding model of the above algorithm.'

abstract: "SUMMARY: Three different protein prenyltransferases (farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferases I and II) catalyze the attachment of prenyl lipid anchors 15 or 20 carbons long to the carboxyl termini of a variety of eukaryotic proteins. Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I both recognize a 'Ca1a2X' motif on their protein substrates; geranylgeranyltransferase II recognizes a different, non-CaaX motif. Each enzyme has two subunits. The genes encoding CaaX protein prenyltransferases are considerably longer than those encoding non-CaaX subunits, as a result of longer introns. Alternative splice forms are predicted to occur, but the extent to which each splice form is translated and the functions of the different resulting isoforms remain to be established. Farnesyltransferase-inhibitor drugs have been developed as anti-cancer agents and may also be able to treat several other diseases. The effects of these inhibitors are complicated, however, by the overlapping substrate specificities of geranylgeranyltransferase I and farnesyltransferase."

abstract: 'Lipid modification of eukaryotic proteins by protein prenyltransferases is required for critical signaling pathways, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton remodeling, induction of apoptosis and vesicular trafficking. This review analyzes the influence of distinct states of sequential posttranslational processing that can be obtained after single or double prenylation, reversible palmitoylation, proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminus and possible reversible carboxymethylation. This series of modifications, as well as the exact length of the prenyl anchor, are determinants in protein-membrane and specific protein-protein interactions of protein prenyltransferase substrates. Furthermore, the occurrence and distribution of pseudogenes of protein prenyltransferase subunits are discussed. Besides being developed as anti-cancer agents, prenyltransferase inhibitors are effective against an increasing number of parasitic diseases. Extensive screens for protein prenyltransferases in genomic data of fungal and protozoan pathogens unveil a series of new pharmacologic targets for prenyltransferase inhibition, including the parasites Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, Aspergillus nidulans, Pneumocystis carinii, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichinella spiralis and Cryptosporidium parvum.'
