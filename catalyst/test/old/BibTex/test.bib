                 community experiment to assess the
                 state-of-the-art in genome annotation within the
                 ENCODE regions, which span 1\% of the human genome
                 sequence. The experiment had two major goals: the
                 assessment of the accuracy of computational
                 methods to predict protein coding genes; and the
                 overall assessment of the completeness of the
                 current human genome annotations as represented in
                 the ENCODE regions. For the computational
                 prediction assessment, eighteen groups contributed
                 gene predictions. We evaluated these submissions
                 against each other based on a 'reference set' of
                 annotations generated as part of the GENCODE
                 project. These annotations were not available to
                 the prediction groups prior to the submission
                 deadline, so that their predictions were blind and
                 an external advisory committee could perform a
                 fair assessment. RESULTS: The best methods had at
                 least one gene transcript correctly predicted for
                 close to 70\% of the annotated
                 genes. Nevertheless, the multiple transcript
                 accuracy, taking into account alternative
                 splicing, reached only approximately 40\% to 50\%
                 accuracy. At the coding nucleotide level, the best
                 programs reached an accuracy of 90\% in both
                 sensitivity and specificity. Programs relying on
                 mRNA and protein sequences were the most accurate
                 in reproducing the manually curated
                 annotations. Experimental validation shows that
                 only a very small percentage (3.2\%) of the
                 selected 221 computationally predicted exons
                 outside of the existing annotation could be
                 verified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such
                 experiment in human DNA, and we have followed the
                 standards established in a similar experiment,
                 GASP1, in Drosophila melanogaster. We believe the
                 results presented here contribute to the value of
                 ongoing large-scale annotation projects and should
                 guide further experimental methods when being
                 scaled up to the entire human genome sequence.},

                 extensively annotated, relatively little
                 information is available for other Caenorhabditis
                 species. The nematode genome annotation assessment
                 project (nGASP) was launched to objectively assess
                 the accuracy of protein-coding gene prediction
                 software in C. elegans, and to apply this
                 knowledge to the annotation of the genomes of four
                 additional Caenorhabditis species and other
                 nematodes. Seventeen groups worldwide participated
                 in nGASP, and submitted 47 prediction sets across
                 10 Mb of the C. elegans genome. Predictions were
                 compared to reference gene sets consisting of
                 confirmed or manually curated gene models from
                 WormBase. RESULTS: The most accurate gene-finders
                 were 'combiner' algorithms, which made use of
                 transcript- and protein-alignments and
                 multi-genome alignments, as well as gene
                 predictions from other gene-finders. Gene-finders
                 that used alignments of ESTs, mRNAs and proteins
                 came in second. There was a tie for third place
                 between gene-finders that used multi-genome
                 alignments and ab initio gene-finders. The median
                 gene level sensitivity of combiners was 78\% and
                 their specificity was 42\%, which is nearly the
                 same accuracy reported for combiners in the human
                 genome. C. elegans genes with exons of unusual
                 hexamer content, as well as those with unusually
                 many exons, short exons, long introns, a weak
                 translation start signal, weak splice sites, or
                 poorly conserved orthologs posed the greatest
                 difficulty for gene-finders. CONCLUSION: This
                 experiment establishes a baseline of gene
                 prediction accuracy in Caenorhabditis genomes, and
                 has guided the choice of gene-finders for the
                 annotation of newly sequenced genomes of
                 Caenorhabditis and other nematode species. We have
                 created new gene sets for C. briggsae, C. remanei,
                 C. brenneri, C. japonica, and Brugia malayi using

                 transcripts that exert their function without ever
                 producing proteins. Noncoding RNA gene sequences
                 do not have strong statistical signals, unlike
                 protein coding genes. A reliable general purpose
                 computational genefinder for noncoding RNA genes
                 has been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a
                 comparative sequence analysis algorithm for
                 detecting novel structural RNA genes. The key idea
                 is to test the pattern of substitutions observed
                 in a pairwise alignment of two homologous
                 sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show
                 a pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a
                 conserved structural RNA tends to show a pattern
                 of compensatory mutations consistent with some
                 base-paired secondary structure. We formalize this
                 intuition using three probabilistic
                 "pair-grammars": a pair stochastic context free
                 grammar modeling alignments constrained by
                 structural RNA evolution, a pair hidden Markov
                 model modeling alignments constrained by coding
                 sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model
                 modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent
                 evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence
                 alignment (e.g. from a BLASTN comparison of two
                 related genomes) we classify the alignment into
                 the coding, RNA, or null class according to the
                 posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS:
                 We have implemented this approach as a program,
                 QRNA, which we consider to be a prototype
                 structural noncoding RNA genefinder. Tests suggest
                 that this approach detects noncoding RNA genes

                 (Coding Region Identification Tool Invoking
                 Comparative Analysis) is a suite of programs for
                 identifying likely protein-coding sequences in DNA
                 by combining comparative analysis of DNA sequences
                 with more common noncomparative methods. In the
                 comparative component of the analysis, regions of
                 DNA are aligned with related sequences from the
                 DNA databases; if the translation of the aligned
                 sequences has greater amino acid identity than
                 expected for the observed percentage nucleotide
                 identity, this is interpreted as evidence for
                 coding. CRITICA also incorporates noncomparative
                 information derived from the relative frequencies
                 of hexanucleotides in coding frames versus other
                 contexts (i.e., dicodon bias). The dicodon usage
                 information is derived by iterative analysis of
                 the data, such that CRITICA is not dependent on
                 the existence or accuracy of coding sequence
                 annotations in the databases. This independence
                 makes the method particularly well suited for the
                 analysis of novel genomes. CRITICA was tested by
                 analyzing the available Salmonella typhimurium DNA
                 sequences. Its predictions were compared with the
                 DNA sequence annotations and with the predictions
                 of GenMark. CRITICA proved to be more accurate
                 than GenMark, and moreover, many of its
                 predictions that would seem to be errors instead
                 reflect problems in the sequence databases. The

                 of coding sequences, efficiently discriminates
                 between coding and non-coding CSTs. The

                 characterized their evolution, defining the
                 regions and mechanisms of change. We then
                 developed methods for direct identification of

                 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding
                 genes remains a matter of controversy. Current
                 catalogs list a total of approximately 24,500
                 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly
                 suspected that a large fraction of these entries
                 are functionally meaningless ORFs present by
                 chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no
                 evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse
                 or dog. However, there is currently no scientific
                 justification for excluding ORFs simply because
                 they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the
                 alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs
                 are actually valid human genes that reflect gene
                 innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in
                 the other lineages. Here, we reject this
                 hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved
                 ORFs-specifically, their properties in other
                 primates. We show that the vast majority of these
                 ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields,
                 as a by-product, a major revision of the current
                 human catalogs, cutting the number of
                 protein-coding genes to approximately
                 20,500. Specifically, it suggests that
                 nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human
                 gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an
                 encoded protein. It also provides a principled
                 methodology for evaluating future proposed
                 additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the
                 results indicate that there has been relatively
                 little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding

                 is a powerful methodology for the discovery of
                 functional genomic elements, and its power should
                 increase with the number of species
                 compared. Here, we use 12 Drosophila genomes to
                 study the power of comparative genomics metrics to
                 distinguish between protein-coding and non-coding
                 regions. First, we study the relative power of
                 different comparative metrics and their
                 relationship to single-species metrics. We find
                 that even relatively simple multi-species metrics
                 robustly outperform advanced single-species
                 metrics, especially for shorter exons ($<$ or =240
                 nt), which are common in animal genomes. Moreover,
                 the two capture largely independent features of
                 protein-coding genes, with different
                 sensitivity/specificity trade-offs, such that
                 their combinations lead to even greater
                 discriminatory power. In addition, we study how
                 discovery power scales with the number and
                 phylogenetic distance of the genomes compared. We
                 find that species at a broad range of distances
                 are comparably effective informants for pairwise
                 comparative gene identification, but that these
                 are surpassed by multi-species comparisons at
                 similar evolutionary divergence. In particular,
                 while pairwise discovery power plateaued at larger
                 distances and never outperformed the most advanced
                 single-species metrics, multi-species comparisons
                 continued to benefit even from the most distant
                 species with no apparent saturation. Last, we find
                 that genes in functional categories typically
                 considered fast-evolving can nonetheless be
                 recovered at very high rates using comparative
                 methods. Our results have implications for
                 comparative genomics analyses in any species,

                 transcripts that do not correspond to known
                 genes. It has been suggested that these
                 transcripts do not encode proteins, but may
                 instead function as RNAs. However, discrimination
                 of coding and non-coding transcripts is not
                 straightforward, and different laboratories have
                 used different methods, whose ability to perform
                 this discrimination is unclear. In this study, we
                 examine ten bioinformatic methods that assess
                 protein-coding potential and compare their ability
                 and congruency in the discrimination of non-coding
                 from coding sequences, based on four underlying
                 principles: open reading frame size, sequence
                 similarity to known proteins or protein domains,
                 statistical models of protein-coding sequence, and
                 synonymous versus non-synonymous substitution
                 rates. Despite these different approaches, the
                 methods show broad concordance, suggesting that
                 coding and non-coding transcripts can, in general,
                 be reliably discriminated, and that many of the
                 recently discovered extra-genic transcripts are
                 indeed non-coding. Comparison of the methods
                 indicates reasons for unreliable predictions, and
                 approaches to increase confidence
                 further. Conversely and surprisingly, our analyses
                 also provide evidence that as much as
                 approximately 10\% of entries in the manually
                 curated protein database Swiss-Prot are erroneous

                 conserved bases are found to lie outside of the
                 exons of known protein-coding genes. In all
                 groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs),
                 by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of
                 bases long. These elements share certain
                 properties with ultraconserved elements, but they
                 tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved,
                 and they overlap genes of somewhat different
                 functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are
                 associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes,
                 stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions
                 rich in moderately conserved noncoding
                 sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong
                 statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA
                 secondary structure.},

                 contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The

                 ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A
                 generalized least-squares method was applied in
                 fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the
                 clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5,
                 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million

                 leading to humans. Although there is some
                 uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a
                 problem for the widely believed hypothesis that
                 the pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis,
                 which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli
                 in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was
                 ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape
                 splitting. Another likelier possibility is that
                 mtDNA was transferred through hybridization
                 between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after
                 the former had developed bipedalism.},

                 sequences of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, and
                 S. bayanus and compared these three yeast species
                 to their close relative, S. cerevisiae. Genomewide
                 comparative analysis allowed the identification of
                 functionally important sequences, both coding and
                 noncoding. In this companion paper we describe the
                 mathematical and algorithmic results underpinning
                 the analysis of these genomes. (1) We present
                 methods for the automatic determination of genome
                 correspondence. The algorithms enabled the
                 automatic identification of orthologs for more
                 than 90\% of genes and intergenic regions across
                 the four species despite the large number of
                 duplicated genes in the yeast genome. The
                 remaining ambiguities in the gene correspondence
                 revealed recent gene family expansions in regions
                 of rapid genomic change. (2) We present methods
                 for the identification of protein-coding genes
                 based on their patterns of nucleotide conservation
                 across related species. We observed the pressure
                 to conserve the reading frame of functional
                 proteins and developed a test for gene
                 identification with high sensitivity and
                 specificity. We used this test to revisit the
                 genome of S. cerevisiae, reducing the overall gene
                 count by 500 genes (10\% of previously annotated
                 genes) and refining the gene structure of hundreds
                 of genes. (3) We present novel methods for the
                 systematic de novo identification of regulatory
                 motifs. The methods do not rely on previous
                 knowledge of gene function and in that way differ
                 from the current literature on computational motif
                 discovery. Based on genomewide conservation
                 patterns of known motifs, we developed three
                 conservation criteria that we used to discover
                 novel motifs. We used an enumeration approach to
                 select strongly conserved motif cores, which we
                 extended and collapsed into a small number of
                 candidate regulatory motifs. These include most
                 previously known regulatory motifs as well as
                 several noteworthy novel motifs. The majority of
                 discovered motifs are enriched in functionally
                 related genes, allowing us to infer a candidate
                 function for novel motifs. Our results demonstrate
                 the power of comparative genomics to further our
                 understanding of any species. Our methods are
                 validated by the extensive experimental knowledge
                 in yeast and will be invaluable in the study of
                 complex genomes like that of the human.},

                 "threaded blockset aligner") builds a threaded
                 blockset under the assumption that all matching
                 segments occur in the same order and orientation
                 in the given sequences; inversions and
                 duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to
                 be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means
                 all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian
                 genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto
                 any genome chosen as a reference, thus
                 guaranteeing that different projections present
                 consistent predictions of which genomic positions
                 are orthologous. This capability is illustrated

                 the complexity of current probabilistic sequence
                 evolution models necessitates fast and reliable
                 phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a
                 new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood
                 principle, which clearly satisfies these
                 requirements. The core of this method is a simple
                 hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology
                 and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm
                 starts from an initial tree built by a fast
                 distance-based method and modifies this tree to
                 improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to
                 this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and
                 branch lengths, only a few iterations are
                 sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive
                 and realistic computer simulations to show that
                 the topological accuracy of this new method is at
                 least as high as that of the existing
                 maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than
                 the performance of distance-based and parsimony
                 approaches. The reduction of computing time is
                 dramatic in comparison with other
                 maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood
                 maximization ability tends to be higher. For
                 example, only 12 min were required on a standard
                 personal computer to analyze a data set consisting
                 of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs from
                 plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same
                 order as some popular distance-based and parsimony
                 algorithms. This new method is implemented in the
                 PHYML program, which is freely available on our

                 into either protein-coding or non-protein-coding
                 categories has pervaded biology for close to 50
                 years. Until recently, discrimination between
                 these two categories was relatively
                 straightforward: most transcripts were clearly
                 identifiable as protein-coding messenger RNAs
                 (mRNAs), and readily distinguished from the small
                 number of well-characterized non-protein-coding
                 RNAs (ncRNAs), such as transfer, ribosomal, and
                 spliceosomal RNAs. Recent genome-wide studies have
                 revealed the existence of thousands of noncoding
                 transcripts, whose function and significance are
                 unclear. The discovery of this hidden
                 transcriptome and the implicit challenge it
                 presents to our understanding of the expression
                 and regulation of genetic information has made the
                 need to distinguish between mRNAs and ncRNAs both
                 more pressing and more complicated. In this
                 Review, we consider the diverse strategies
                 employed to discriminate between protein-coding
                 and noncoding transcripts and the fundamental
                 difficulties that are inherent in what may
                 superficially appear to be a simple
                 problem. Misannotations can also run in both
                 directions: some ncRNAs may actually encode
                 peptides, and some of those currently thought to
                 do so may not. Moreover, recent studies have shown
                 that some RNAs can function both as mRNAs and
                 intrinsically as functional ncRNAs, which may be a
                 relatively widespread phenomenon. We conclude that
                 it is difficult to annotate an RNA unequivocally
                 as protein-coding or noncoding, with overlapping
                 protein-coding and noncoding transcripts further
                 confounding this distinction. In addition, the
                 finding that some transcripts can function both
                 intrinsically at the RNA level and to encode
                 proteins suggests a false dichotomy between mRNAs
                 and ncRNAs. Therefore, the functionality of any
                 transcript at the RNA level should not be
                 discounted.},

                 assemblages. Several such 'metatranscriptomic'
                 studies have reported that many complementary DNA
                 sequences shared no significant homology with
                 known peptide sequences, and so might represent
                 transcripts from uncharacterized proteins. Here we
                 report that a large fraction of cDNA sequences
                 detected in microbial metatranscriptomic data sets
                 are comprised of well-known small RNAs (sRNAs), as
                 well as new groups of previously unrecognized
                 putative sRNAs (psRNAs). These psRNAs mapped
                 specifically to intergenic regions of microbial
                 genomes recovered from similar habitats, displayed
                 characteristic conserved secondary structures and
                 were frequently flanked by genes that indicated
                 potential regulatory functions. Depth-dependent
                 variation of psRNAs generally reflected known
                 depth distributions of broad taxonomic groups, but
                 fine-scale differences in the psRNAs within
                 closely related populations indicated potential
                 roles in niche adaptation. Genome-specific mapping
                 of a subset of psRNAs derived from predominant

                 distribution and abundance of sRNAs in naturally

                 structures can be used to identify functional
                 noncoding RNAs in genomic screens. It was shown
                 recently by Babak et al. [BMC
                 Bioinformatics. 8:33] that RNA gene prediction
                 programs can be biased by the genomic dinucleotide
                 content, in particular those programs using a
                 thermodynamic folding model including stacking
                 energies. As a consequence, there is need for
                 dinucleotide-preserving control strategies to
                 assess the significance of such predictions. While
                 there have been randomization algorithms for
                 single sequences for many years, the problem has
                 remained challenging for multiple alignments and
                 there is currently no algorithm
                 available. RESULTS: We present a program called
                 SISSIz that simulates multiple alignments of a
                 given average dinucleotide content. Meeting
                 additional requirements of an accurate null model,
                 the randomized alignments are on average of the
                 same sequence diversity and preserve local
                 conservation and gap patterns. We make use of a
                 phylogenetic substitution model that includes
                 overlapping dependencies and site-specific
                 rates. Using fast heuristics and a distance based
                 approach, a tree is estimated under this model
                 which is used to guide the simulations. The new
                 algorithm is tested on vertebrate genomic
                 alignments and the effect on RNA structure
                 predictions is studied. In addition, we directly
                 combined the new null model with the RNAalifold
                 consensus folding algorithm giving a new variant
                 of a thermodynamic structure based RNA gene
                 finding program that is not biased by the
                 dinucleotide content. CONCLUSION: SISSIz
                 implements an efficient algorithm to randomize
                 multiple alignments preserving dinucleotide
                 content. It can be used to get more accurate
                 estimates of false positive rates of existing
                 programs, to produce negative controls for the
                 training of machine learning based programs, or as
                 standalone RNA gene finding program. Other

                 RNA genes from the genomic background. Additional

                 of genome annotation, and perhaps more
                 importantly, few annotated short open reading
                 frames have been confirmed to correspond to

  abstract =     {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are required for maintenance
                 of pluripotency as well as differentiation, but
                 since more microRNAs have been computationally
                 predicted in genome than have been found, there
                 are likely to be undiscovered microRNAs expressed
                 early in stem cell
                 differentiation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
                 SOLiD ultra-deep sequencing identified $>$10(7)
                 unique small RNAs from human embryonic stem cells
                 (hESC) and neural-restricted precursors that were
                 fit to a model of microRNA biogenesis to
                 computationally predict 818 new microRNA
                 genes. These predicted genomic loci are associated
                 with chromatin patterns of modified histones that
                 are predictive of regulated gene expression. 146
                 of the predicted microRNAs were enriched in
                 Ago2-containing complexes along with 609 known
                 microRNAs, demonstrating association with a
                 functional RISC complex. This Ago2 IP-selected
                 subset was consistently expressed in four
                 independent hESC lines and exhibited complex
                 patterns of regulation over development similar to
                 previously-known microRNAs, including
                 pluripotency-specific expression in both hESC and
                 iPS cells. More than 30\% of the Ago2 IP-enriched
                 predicted microRNAs are new members of existing
                 families since they share seed sequences with
                 known microRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
                 Extending the classic definition of microRNAs,
                 this large number of new microRNA genes, the
                 majority of which are less conserved than their
                 canonical counterparts, likely represent
                 evolutionarily recent regulators of early
                 differentiation. The enrichment in Ago2 containing
                 complexes, the presence of chromatin marks
                 indicative of regulated gene expression, and
                 differential expression over development all
                 support the identification of 146 new microRNAs
                 active during early hESC differentiation.},

                 amino acid sequences in a protein database has
                 been developed. The fragmentation patterns
                 observed in the tandem mass spectra of peptides
                 containing covalent modifications is used to
                 directly search and fit linear amino acid
                 sequences in the database. Specific information
                 relevant to sites of modification is not contained
                 in the character-based sequence information of the
                 databases. The search method considers each
                 putative modification site as both modified and
                 unmodified in one pass through the database and
                 simultaneously considers up to three different
                 sites of modification. The search method will
                 identify the correct sequence if the tandem mass
                 spectrum did not represent a modified
                 peptide. This approach is demonstrated with
                 peptides containing modifications such as
                 S-carboxymethylated cysteine, oxidized methionine,
                 phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or
                 phosphotyrosine. In addition, a scanning approach

                 provides a convenient method to match the nascent
                 tandem mass spectra of modified peptides to
                 sequences in a protein database and thereby

  abstract =     {Several algorithms have been described in the
                 literature for protein identification by searching
                 a sequence database using mass spectrometry
                 data. In some approaches, the experimental data
                 are peptide molecular weights from the digestion
                 of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use
                 tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or
                 more peptides. Still others combine mass data with
                 amino acid sequence data. We present results from
                 a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates
                 all three types of search. The scoring algorithm
                 is probability based, which has a number of
                 advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge
                 whether a result is significant or not. This is
                 particularly useful in guarding against false
                 positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those
                 from other types of search, such as sequence
                 homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily
                 optimised by iteration. The strengths and
                 limitations of probability-based scoring are
                 discussed, particularly in the context of high
                 throughput, fully automated protein
                 identification.},

                 fragmenting peptide ions contain some peptide
                 sequence specific information, but often there is
                 not enough information to sequence the original
                 peptide completely. Several proprietary software
                 applications have been developed to attempt to
                 match the spectra with a list of protein sequences
                 that may contain the sequence of the peptide. The
                 application TANDEM was written to provide the
                 proteomics research community with a set of
                 components that can be used to test new methods
                 and algorithms for performing this type of
                 sequence-to-data matching. AVAILABILITY: The

                 issue by using centrifugal ultrafiltration to
                 enrich the low-molecular-weight (LMW) serum
                 proteome while decreasing the amount of abundant
                 high-molecular-weight proteins. Reduction of the
                 complex nature of the sample was achieved by
                 fractionation of the LMW serum proteins using
                 solution-phase isoelectric focusing
                 (IEF). Multiple enzyme digestions are performed
                 and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
                 spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analysis of the tandem
                 mass spectra resulted in the identification of 262
                 proteins belonging to LMW serum proteome. Our
                 results demonstrate the effectiveness of this

                 improvements in two respects: (1) The accuracy is
                 increased by the systematic use of dinucleotide

                 alignments with more than six sequences, are
                 overcome by increased training data and the usage
                 of an entropy measure to represent sequence
                 similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower
                 false discovery rate on a dinucleotide background
                 model than the previous version. Separate models

  abstract =     {RNAIII is the intracellular effector of the
                 quorum-sensing system in Staphylococcus aureus. It
                 is one of the largest regulatory RNAs (514
                 nucleotides long) that are known to control the
                 expression of a large number of virulence
                 genes. Here, we show that the 3' domain of RNAIII
                 coordinately represses at the post-transcriptional
                 level, the expression of mRNAs that encode a class
                 of virulence factors that act early in the
                 infection process. We demonstrate that the 3'
                 domain acts primarily as an antisense RNA and
                 rapidly anneals to these mRNAs, forming long RNA
                 duplexes. The interaction between RNAIII and the
                 mRNAs results in repression of translation
                 initiation and triggers endoribonuclease III
                 hydrolysis. These processes are followed by rapid
                 depletion of the mRNA pool. In addition, we show
                 that RNAIII and its 3' domain mediate
                 translational repression of rot mRNA through a
                 limited number of base pairings involving two
                 loop-loop interactions. Since Rot is a
                 transcriptional regulatory protein, we proposed
                 that RNAIII indirectly acts on many downstream
                 genes, resulting in the activation of the
                 synthesis of several exoproteins. These data
                 emphasize the multitude of regulatory steps
                 affected by RNAIII and its 3' domain in
                 establishing a network of S. aureus virulence
                 factors.},
