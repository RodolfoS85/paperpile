   abstract = {MOTIVATION: In eukaryotes, the family of non-coding RNA genes includes a number of genes encoding small nucleolar RNAs (mainly C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs), which act as guides in the maturation or post-transcriptional modifications of target RNA molecules. Since in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) only few examples of snoRNAs have been identified so far by cDNA libraries screening, integration of the molecular data with in silico identification of these types of genes could throw light on their organization in the Dm genome. RESULTS: We have performed a computational screening of the Dm genome for C/D snoRNA genes, followed by experimental validation of the putative candidates. Few of the 26 confirmed snoRNAs had been recognized by cDNA library analysis. Organization of the Dm genome was also found to be more variegated than previously suspected, with snoRNA genes nested in both the introns and exons of protein-coding genes. This finding suggests that the presence of additional mechanisms of snoRNA biogenesis based on the alternative production of overlapping mRNA/snoRNA molecules.

                  measure of the amount of change needed to transform
                  one sequence into the other. Given two sequences
                  with a small distance between them, can their
                  similarity be explained by their base composition
                  alone? The nucleotide order of these sequences
                  contributes to their similarity if the distance is
                  much smaller than their average permutation
                  distance, which is obtained by calculating the
                  distances for many random permutations of these
                  sequences. To determine whether their similarity can
                  be explained by their dinucleotide and codon usage,
                  random sequences must be chosen from the set of
                  permuted sequences that preserve dinucleotide and

                  dinucleotide and codon-preserving permutations can
                  be expressed in the language of graph theory as the
                  problem of generating random Eulerian walks on a
                  directed multigraph. An efficient algorithm for
                  generating such walks is described. This algorithm
                  can be used to choose random sequence permutations
                  that preserve (1) dinucleotide usage, (2)
                  dinucleotide and trinucleotide usage, or (3)
                  dinucleotide and codon usage. For example, the
                  similarity of two 60-nucleotide DNA segments from
                  the human beta-1 interferon gene (nucleotides
                  196-255 and 499-558) is not just the result of their
                  nonrandom dinucleotide and codon usage.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Whole genome sequencing of marine
                  cyanobacteria has revealed an unprecedented degree
                  of genomic variation and streamlining. With a size
                  of 1.66 megabase-pairs, Prochlorococcus sp. MED4 has
                  the most compact of these genomes and it is
                  enigmatic how the few identified regulatory proteins
                  efficiently sustain the lifestyle of an ecologically
                  successful marine microorganism. Small non-coding
                  RNAs (ncRNAs) control a plethora of processes in
                  eukaryotes as well as in bacteria; however,
                  systematic searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for
                  most eubacterial phyla outside the
                  enterobacteria.RESULTS:Based on a computational
                  prediction we show the presence of several ncRNAs
                  (cyanobacterial functional RNA or Yfr) in several
                  different cyanobacteria of the
                  Prochlorococcus-Synechococcus lineage. Some ncRNA
                  genes are present only in two or three of the four
                  strains investigated, whereas the RNAs Yfr2 through
                  Yfr5 are structurally highly related and are encoded
                  by a rapidly evolving gene family as their genes
                  exist in different copy numbers and at different
                  sites in the four investigated genomes. One ncRNA,
                  Yfr7, is present in at least seven other
                  cyanobacteria. In addition, control elements for
                  several ribosomal operons were predicted as well as
                  riboswitches for thiamine pyrophosphate and
                  cobalamin.CONCLUSION:This is the first genome-wide
                  and systematic screen for ncRNAs in
                  cyanobacteria. Several ncRNAs were both
                  computationally predicted and their presence was
                  biochemically verified. These RNAs may have
                  regulatory functions and each shows a distinct
                  phylogenetic distribution. Our approach can be
                  applied to any group of microorganisms for which
                  more than one total genome sequence is available for
                  comparative analysis.},

                  subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 is a structural
                  component of the viral prohead and is required for
                  the ATP-dependent packaging of DNA. Here we report a
                  model of secondary structure for this prohead RNA
                  developed from a phylogenetic analysis of the
                  primary sequences of prohead RNAs of related
                  phages. Twenty-nine phages related to phi 29 were
                  found to produce prohead RNAs. These RNAs were
                  analyzed by their ability to replace phi 29 RNA in
                  in vitro phage assembly, by Northern blot
                  hybridization with a probe complementary to phi 29
                  RNA, and by partial and complete sequence
                  analyses. These analyses revealed four quite
                  different sequences ranging in length from 161 to
                  174 residues. The secondary structure deduced from
                  these sequences, in agreement with earlier
                  observations, indicated that prohead RNA is
                  organized into two domains. The larger 5'-domain
                  (Domain I) is composed of 113-117 residues and
                  contains four helices. Three of these helices appear
                  to be organized into a central stem that is
                  interrupted by two unpaired loops and the fourth
                  helix and loop. The smaller 3'-domain (Domain II) is
                  composed of 40-44 residues and consists of two
                  helices. Domains I and II are separated by 8-13
                  unpaired residues. Nuclease cleavage occurs readily
                  in this single-stranded joining region, and this
                  cleavage allows the subsequent separation of the two
                  RNA domains. The separated Domain I is fully active
                  in DNA packaging in vitro. The functional
                  significance and biological role of Domain II are
                  unknown. The phylogenetic secondary structure model
                  provides a basis for further analysis of the role of
                  this RNA in bacteriophage morphogenesis.}",

                  with no insertions or deletions) between orthologous
                  regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. Nearly
                  all of these segments are also conserved in the
                  chicken and dog genomes, with an average of 95 and
                  99\% identity, respectively. Many are also
                  significantly conserved in fish. These
                  ultraconserved elements of the human genome are most
                  often located either overlapping exons in genes
                  involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby
                  genes involved in the regulation of transcription
                  and development. Along with more than 5000 sequences
                  of over 100 bp that are absolutely conserved among
                  the three sequenced mammals, these represent a class
                  of genetic elements whose functions and evolutionary
                  origins are yet to be determined, but which are more
                  highly conserved between these species than are
                  proteins and appear to be essential for the ontogeny
                  of mammals and other vertebrates.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: It is currently believed that the human
                  genome contains about twice as much non-coding
                  functional regions as it does protein-coding genes,
                  yet our understanding of these regions is very
                  limited. RESULTS: We examine the intersection
                  between syntenically conserved sequences in the
                  human, mouse and rat genomes, and sequence
                  similarities within the human genome itself, in
                  search of families of non-protein-coding
                  elements. For this purpose we develop a graph
                  theoretic clustering algorithm, akin to the highly
                  successful methods used in elucidating protein
                  sequence family relationships. The algorithm is
                  applied to a highly filtered set of about 700 000
                  human-rodent evolutionarily conserved regions, not
                  resembling any known coding sequence, which
                  encompasses 3.7\% of the human genome. From these,
                  we obtain roughly 12 000 non-singleton clusters,
                  dense in significant sequence similarities. Further
                  analysis of genomic location, evidence of
                  transcription and RNA secondary structure reveals
                  many clusters to be significantly homogeneous in one
                  or more characteristics. This subset of the highly
                  conserved non-protein-coding elements in the human
                  genome thus contains rich family-like structures,
                  which merit in-depth analysis. AVAILABILITY:

                  popular method for prediction of classically
                  secreted proteins, SignalP. SignalP consists of two
                  different predictors based on neural network and
                  hidden Markov model algorithms, where both
                  components have been updated. Motivated by the idea
                  that the cleavage site position and the amino acid
                  composition of the signal peptide are correlated,
                  new features have been included as input to the
                  neural network. This addition, combined with a
                  thorough error-correction of a new data set, have
                  improved the performance of the predictor
                  significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3,
                  correctness of the cleavage site predictions has
                  increased notably for all three organism groups,
                  eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive
                  bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction
                  has increased in the range 6-17\% over the previous
                  version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination
                  improvement is mainly due to the elimination of
                  false-positive predictions, as well as the
                  introduction of a new discrimination score for the
                  neural network. The new method has been benchmarked
                  against other available methods. Predictions can be

                  nucleotides that specifically regulate cellular gene
                  expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs
                  are derived from the maturation by cellular RNases
                  III of imperfect stem loop structures of ~ 70
                  nucleotides. Evidence for hundreds of miRNAs and
                  their corresponding targets has been reported in the
                  literature for plants, insects, invertebrate
                  animals, and mammals. While not all of these
                  miRNA/target pairs have been functionally verified,
                  some clearly serve roles in regulating normal
                  development and physiology. Recently, it has been
                  queried whether the genome of human viruses like
                  their cellular counterpart also encode miRNA. To
                  date, there has been only one report pertaining to
                  this question. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been
                  shown to encode five miRNAs. Here, we extend the
                  analysis of miRNA-encoding potential to the human
                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Using
                  computer-directed analyses, we found that HIV
                  putatively encodes five candidate pre-miRNAs. We
                  then matched deduced mature miRNA sequences from
                  these 5 pre-miRNAs against a database of 3'
                  untranslated sequences (UTR) from the human
                  genome. These searches revealed a large number of
                  cellular transcripts that could potentially be
                  targeted by these viral miRNA (vmiRNA) sequences. We
                  propose that HIV has evolved to use vmiRNAs as a
                  means to regulate cellular milieu for its benefit.}",

                  a very important functional role in the cell. No
                  distinctive general features common to all ncRNA
                  have yet been discovered. This makes it difficult to
                  design computational tools able to detect novel
                  ncRNAs in the genomic sequence. RESULTS: We devised
                  an algorithm able to detect conserved secondary
                  structures in both pairwise and multiple DNA
                  sequence alignments with computational time
                  proportional to the square of the sequence
                  length. We implemented the algorithm for the case of
                  pairwise and three-way alignments and tested it on
                  ncRNAs obtained from public databases. On the test
                  sets, the pairwise algorithm has a specificity
                  greater than 97\% with a sensitivity varying from
                  22.26\% for Blast alignments to 56.35\% for
                  structural alignments. The three-way algorithm

                  is a novel generalization of the classic notion of a
                  multiple alignment. A new computer program called
                  TBA (for \&quot;threaded blockset aligner\&quot;)
                  builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that
                  all matching segments occur in the same order and
                  orientation in the given sequences; inversions and
                  duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to
                  be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means
                  all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian
                  genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any
                  genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that
                  different projections present consistent predictions
                  of which genomic positions are orthologous. This
                  capability is illustrated using a new visualization
                  tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate
                  Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish
                  perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment
                  quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary
                  change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is
                  more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the
                  dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a
                  stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used
                  to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced
                  genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce
                  the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa

                  by a specific secondary and tertiary structure that
                  determines their function. Here, we investigate the
                  folding energy of the secondary structure of
                  non-coding RNA sequences such as microRNA
                  precursors, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs in
                  several eukaryotic taxa. Statistical biases are
                  assessed by a randomization test, in which the
                  predicted minimum free energy of folding is compared
                  with values obtained for structures inferred from
                  randomly shuffling the original sequences. RESULTS:
                  In contrast with transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs,
                  the majority of the microRNA sequences clearly
                  exhibit a folding free energy that is considerably
                  lower than that for shuffled sequences, indicating a
                  high tendency in the sequence towards a stable

                  a data-driven method for solving classification
                  tasks. It has been shown to produce lower prediction
                  error compared to classifiers based on other methods
                  like artificial neural networks, especially when
                  large numbers of features are considered for sample
                  description. In this review, the theory and main
                  principles of the SVM approach are outlined, and
                  successful applications in traditional areas of
                  bioinformatics research are described. Current
                  developments in techniques related to the SVM

                  for future functional genomics and chemogenomics
                  projects. In a comparative study, we developed
                  neural network and SVM models to identify small
                  organic molecules that potentially modulate the
                  function of G-protein coupled receptors. The SVM
                  system was able to correctly classify approximately
                  90\% of the compounds in a cross-validation study
                  yielding a Matthews correlation coefficient of
                  0.78. This classifier can be used for fast filtering
                  of compound libraries in virtual screening
                  applications.}

                  functional RNAs (fRNAs) in genomic sequences. We
                  have developed a machine learning approach using
                  neural networks and support vector machines to
                  extract common features among known RNAs for
                  prediction of new RNA genes in the unannotated
                  regions of prokaryotic and archaeal genomes. The
                  Escherichia coli genome was used for development,
                  but we have applied this method to several other
                  bacterial and archaeal genomes. Networks based on
                  nucleotide composition were 80-90\% accurate in
                  jackknife testing experiments for bacteria and
                  90-99\% for hyperthermophilic archaea. We also
                  achieved a significant improvement in accuracy by
                  combining these predictions with those obtained
                  using a second set of parameters consisting of known
                  RNA sequence motifs and the calculated free energy
                  of folding. Several known fRNAs not included in the
                  training datasets were identified as well as several
                  hundred predicted novel RNAs. These studies indicate
                  that there are many unidentified RNAs in simple
                  genomes that can be predicted computationally as a
                  precursor to experimental study. Public access to
                  our RNA gene predictions and an interface for user
                  predictions is available via the web.}

                  sites in vivo for three DNA binding transcription
                  factors, Sp1, cMyc, and p53, in an unbiased
                  manner. This mapping reveals an unexpectedly large
                  number of transcription factor binding site (TFBS)
                  regions, with a minimal estimate of 12,000 for Sp1,
                  25,000 for cMyc, and 1600 for p53 when extrapolated
                  to the full genome. Only 22\% of these TFBS regions
                  are located at the 5' termini of protein-coding
                  genes while 36\% lie within or immediately 3' to
                  well-characterized genes and are significantly

                  protein-coding and noncoding RNAs are often
                  coregulated. Thus, the human genome contains roughly
                  comparable numbers of protein-coding and noncoding
                  genes that are bound by common transcription factors
                  and regulated by common environmental signals.}

                  requirements for Monte Carlo simulation, it becomes
                  impractical even using a supercomputer to assess the
                  significance of a structure with a window size
                  greater than 200 along an RNA sequence of 1000 bases
                  or more. In this paper, we have developed a new
                  procedure that drastically reduces the time needed
                  to assess the significance of structures. In fact,
                  the efficiency of this new method allows us to
                  assess structures on the VAX as well as the CRAY.}

                  microevolutionary phenomena that have shaped the
                  human, mouse, and rat genomes since their last
                  common ancestor. We find evidence for a shift in the
                  mutational spectrum between the mouse and rat
                  lineages, with the net effect being a relative
                  increase in GC content in the rat genome. Our
                  estimate for the neutral point substitution rate
                  separating the two rodents is 0.196 substitutions
                  per site, and 0.65 substitutions per site for the
                  tree relating all three mammals. Small insertions
                  and deletions of 1-10 bp in length
                  (\&quot;microindels\&quot;) occur at approximately
                  5\% of the point substitution rate. Inferred
                  regional correlations in evolutionary rates between
                  lineages and between types of sites support the idea
                  that rates of evolution are influenced by local
                  genomic or cell biological context. No substantial
                  correlations between rates of point substitutions
                  and rates of microindels are found, however,
                  implying that the influences that affect these
                  processes are distinct. Finally, we have identified
                  those regions in the human genome that are evolving
                  slowly, which are likely to include functional
                  elements important to human biology. At least 5\% of
                  the human genome is under substantial constraint,
                  most of which is noncoding.}

                  approach is growing increasingly feasible as the
                  genomes of ever more organisms are sequenced. A
                  program called MSARI implements this method and is
                  significantly more accurate than existing methods in
                  the context of automatically generated alignments,
                  making it particularly applicable to high-throughput
                  scans. In our tests, it discerned CLUSTALW-generated
                  multiple sequence alignments of signal recognition
                  particle or RNaseP orthologs from controls with
                  89.1\% sensitivity at 97.5\% specificity and with
                  74.4\% sensitivity with no false positives in 494
                  controls. We used MSARI to conduct a comprehensive
                  scan for secondary structure in mRNAs of coding
                  genes, and we found many genes with known mRNA
                  secondary structure and compelling evidence for
                  secondary structure in other genes. MSARI uses a
                  method for coping with sequence redundancy that is
                  likely to have applications in a large set of other
                  comparison-based search methods. The program is

                  Yersinia species},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found
                  in bacteria, post-transcriptionally regulates
                  expression of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) by
                  interaction with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR. Phylogenetic
                  data can be useful for RNA/RNA duplex structure
                  analyses and aid in elucidation of mechanism of
                  regulation. However micF and associated genes, ompF
                  and ompC are difficult to annotate because of either
                  similarities or divergences in nucleotide
                  sequence. We report by using sequences that
                  represent "gene signatures" as probes, e.g., mRNA
                  5'UTR sequences, closely related genes can be
                  accurately located in genomic sequences. RESULTS:
                  Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST
                  programs have been used to identify micF, ompF and
                  ompC in Yersinia pestis and Yersinia
                  enterocolitica. By alignment with DNA sequences from
                  other bacterial species, 5' start sites of genes and
                  upstream transcriptional regulatory sites in
                  promoter regions were predicted. Annotated genes
                  from Yersinia species provide phylogenetic
                  information on the micF regulatory system. High
                  sequence conservation in binding sites of
                  transcriptional regulatory factors are found in the
                  promoter region upstream of micF and conservation in
                  blocks of sequences as well as marked sequence
                  variation is seen in segments of the micF RNA
                  gene. Unexpected large differences in rates of
                  evolution were found between the interacting RNA
                  transcripts, micF RNA and the 5' UTR of the ompF
                  mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex structures
                  were modeled by the mfold program. Functional
                  domains such as RNA/RNA interacting sites appear to
                  display a minimum of evolutionary drift in sequence
                  with the exception of a significant change in
                  Y. enterocolitica micF RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Newly
                  annotated Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the
                  resultant RNA/RNA duplex structures add strong
                  phylogenetic support for a generalized duplex
                  model. The alignment and search approach using 5'
                  UTR signatures may be a model to help define other
                  genes and their start sites when annotated genes are
                  available in well-defined reference organisms.},

                  methods based on probabilistic modeling can be
                  developed using stochastic context-free grammars
                  (SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine different
                  sources of information that can be expressed
                  probabilistically, such as an evolutionary model of
                  comparative RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical
                  model of structure plausibility. However, the number
                  of free parameters in an integrated model for
                  consensus RNA structure prediction can become
                  untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too
                  complex. Thus a key question is, what small, simple
                  SCFG designs perform best for RNA secondary
                  structure prediction? RESULTS: Nine different small
                  SCFGs were implemented to explore the tradeoffs
                  between model complexity and prediction
                  accuracy. Each model was tested for single sequence
                  structure prediction accuracy on a benchmark set of
                  RNA secondary structures. CONCLUSIONS: Four SCFG
                  designs had prediction accuracies near the
                  performance of current energy minimization
                  programs. One of these designs, introduced by
                  Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only
                  21 free parameters and is significantly simpler than
                  the others.}

                  the yeast genome for novel H/ACA snoRNAs. To achieve
                  this, we introduce some new methods for facilitating
                  the search for noncoding RNAs in genomic sequences
                  which are based on properties of predicted minimum

                  snoRNAs. Only the use of secondary structure filters
                  reduces the number of candidates to a manageable
                  size. From genomic context, we identify three strong
                  H/ACA snoRNA candidates. These together with a
                  further 47 candidates obtained by our analysis are
                  being experimentally screened.}

  abstract =	 {We describe EnteriX, a suite of three web-based
                  visualization tools for graphically portraying
                  alignment information from comparisons among several
                  fixed and user-supplied sequences from related
                  enterobacterial species, anchored on a reference
                  genome (http://bio.cse.psu.edu/). The first
                  visualization, Enteric, displays stacked pairwise
                  alignments between a reference genome and each of
                  the related bacteria, represented schematically as
                  PIPs (Percent Identity Plots). Encoded in the views
                  are large-scale genomic rearrangement events and
                  functional landmarks. The second visualization,
                  Menteric, computes and displays 1 Kb views of
                  nucleotide-level multiple alignments of the
                  sequences, together with annotations of genes,
                  regulatory sites and conserved regions. The third, a
                  Java-based tool named Maj, displays alignment
                  information in two formats, corresponding roughly to
                  the Enteric and Menteric views, and adds zoom-in
                  capabilities. The uses of such tools are diverse,
                  from examining the multiple sequence alignment to
                  infer conserved sites with potential regulatory
                  roles, to scrutinizing the commonalities and
                  differences between the genomes for pathogenicity or
                  phylogenetic studies. The EnteriX suite currently
                  includes \&gt;15 enterobacterial genomes, generates
                  views centered on four different anchor genomes and
                  provides support for including user sequences in the
                  alignments.}

  abstract =	 {To date, few attempts have been made to benchmark
                  the alignment algorithms upon nucleic acid
                  sequences. Frequently, sophisticated PAM or BLOSUM
                  like models are used to align proteins, yet
                  equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids;
                  instead, rather ad hoc models are generally
                  favoured. Here, we systematically test the
                  performance of existing alignment algorithms on
                  structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving
                  the following goals: (i) to determine conditions
                  where it is appropriate to apply common sequence
                  alignment methods to the structural RNA alignment
                  problem. This indicates where and when researchers
                  should consider augmenting the alignment process
                  with auxiliary information, such as secondary
                  structure and (ii) to determine which sequence
                  alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest
                  range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment
                  alone, using the current algorithms, is generally
                  inappropriate \&lt;50-60\% sequence
                  identity. Second, we note that the probabilistic
                  method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms
                  generally outperform other sequence-based
                  algorithms, under the broadest range of
                  applications.}

  abstract =	 {We present here a new approach to the problem of
                  defining RNA signatures and finding their
                  occurrences in sequence databases. The proposed
                  method is based on \&quot;secondary structure
                  profiles\&quot;. An RNA sequence alignment with
                  secondary structure information is used as an
                  input. Two types of weight matrices/profiles are
                  constructed from this alignment: single strands are
                  represented by a classical lod-scores profile while
                  helical regions are represented by an extended
                  \&quot;helical profile\&quot; comprising 16
                  lod-scores per position, one for each of the 16
                  possible base-pairs. Database searches are then
                  conducted using a simultaneous search for helical
                  profiles and dynamic programming alignment of single
                  strand profiles. The algorithm has been implemented
                  into a new software, ERPIN, that performs both
                  profile construction and database
                  search. Applications are presented for several RNA
                  motifs. The automated use of sequence information in
                  both single-stranded and helical regions yields
                  better sensitivity/specificity ratios than
                  descriptor-based programs. Furthermore, since the
                  translation of alignments into profiles is
                  straightforward with ERPIN, iterative searches can
                  easily be conducted to enrich collections of
                  homologous RNAs.}

                  of human, mouse, and rat genomes that appear to be
                  essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny. Here,
                  we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved
                  genomic regions between the insect species
                  Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
                  pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related
                  Anopheles gambiae. As with vertebrates,
                  ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur
                  primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences, and
                  at intron-exon junctions. The sequences are
                  significantly associated with genes encoding
                  developmental regulators and transcription factors,
                  but are less frequent and are smaller in size than
                  in vertebrates. The longest identical, nongapped
                  orthologous match between the three genomes was
                  found within the homothorax (hth) gene. This
                  sequence spans an internal exon-intron junction,
                  with the majority located within the intron, and is
                  predicted to form a highly stable stem-loop RNA
                  structure. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of
                  different hth splice isoforms and Northern blotting
                  showed that the conserved element is associated with
                  a high incidence of intron retention in hth
                  pre-mRNA, suggesting that the conserved intronic
                  element is critically important in the
                  post-transcriptional regulation of hth expression in
                  Diptera.}

                  that, during replication, their lengthy genome is
                  squeezed with remarkable velocity into a preformed
                  procapsid and packed into near crystalline
                  density. A molecular motor using ATP as energy
                  accomplishes this energetically unfavorable motion
                  tack. In bacterial virus phi29, an RNA (pRNA)
                  molecule is a vital component of this motor. This
                  120-base RNA has many novel and distinctive
                  features. It contains strong secondary structure, is
                  tightly folded, and unusually stable. Upon
                  interaction with ion and proteins, it has a knack to
                  adapt numerous conformations to perform versatile
                  function. It can be easily manipulated to form

                  framework for the regulation of iron uptake,
                  storage, and utilization has been defined. Two
                  cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, iron-regulatory
                  protein-1 (IRP-1) and IRP-2, respond to changes in
                  cellular iron availability and coordinate the
                  expression of mRNAs that harbor IRP-binding sites,
                  iron-responsive elements (IREs). Nitric oxide (NO)
                  and oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 also signal
                  to IRPs and thereby influence cellular iron
                  metabolism. The recent discovery of two
                  IRE-regulated mRNAs encoding enzymes of the
                  mitochondrial citric acid cycle may represent the
                  beginnings of elucidating regulatory coupling
                  between iron and energy metabolism. In addition to
                  providing insights into the regulation of iron
                  metabolism and its connections with other cellular
                  pathways, the IRE/IRP system has emerged as a prime
                  example for the understanding of translational
                  regulation and mRNA stability control. Finally,
                  IRP-1 has highlighted an unexpected role for iron
                  sulfur clusters as post-translational regulatory
                  switches.}

                  RNAs, most prominently the miRNAs have been
                  discovered, strongly suggesting that further types
                  of functional RNAs are still hidden in the recently
                  completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques
                  are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA
                  genes. When sufficiently similar sequences are not
                  available for comparative approaches the only known
                  remedy is to search directly for structural
                  features. RESULTS: We present here efficient
                  algorithms for computing locally stable RNA
                  structures at genome-wide scales. Both the minimum
                  energy structure and the complete matrix of base
                  pairing probabilities can be computed in O(N x L(2))
                  time and O(N + L(2)) memory in terms of the length N
                  of the genome and the size L of the largest
                  secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice,
                  the 100 Mb of the complete genome of Caenorhabditis
                  elegans can be folded within about half a day on a
                  modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is
                  sufficient example for a survey for

                  are characterized by highly conserved secondary
                  structures but little detectable sequence
                  similarity. Reliable multiple alignments can
                  therefore be constructed only when the shared
                  structural features are taken into account. Since
                  multiple alignments are used as input for many
                  subsequent methods of data analysis, structure based
                  alignments are an indispensable necessity in RNA
                  bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present here a method to
                  compute pairwise and progressive multiple alignments
                  from the direct comparison of basepairing
                  probability matrices. Instead of attempting to solve
                  the folding and the alignment problem simultaneously
                  as in the classical Sankoff algorithm we use
                  McCaskill's approach to compute base pairing
                  probability matrices which effectively incorporate
                  the information on the energetics of each
                  sequences. A novel, simplified variant of Sankoff's
                  algorithms can then be employed to extract the
                  maximum weight common secondary structure and an
                  associated alignment. AVAILABILITY: The programs

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Pairwise stochastic context-free
                  grammars (Pair SCFGs) are powerful tools for
                  evolutionary analysis of RNA, including simultaneous
                  RNA sequence alignment and secondary structure
                  prediction, but the associated algorithms are
                  intensive in both CPU and memory usage. The same
                  problem is faced by other RNA alignment-and-folding
                  algorithms based on Sankoff's 1985 algorithm. It is
                  therefore desirable to constrain such algorithms, by
                  pre-processing the sequences and using this first
                  pass to limit the range of structures and/or
                  alignments that can be considered. RESULTS: We
                  demonstrate how flexible classes of constraint can
                  be imposed, greatly reducing the computational costs
                  while maintaining a high quality of structural
                  homology prediction. Any score-attributed
                  context-free grammar (e.g. energy-based scoring
                  schemes, or conditionally normalized Pair SCFGs) is
                  amenable to this treatment. It is now possible to
                  combine independent structural and alignment
                  constraints of unprecedented general flexibility in
                  Pair SCFG alignment algorithms. We outline several
                  applications to the bioinformatics of RNA sequence
                  and structure, including Waterman-Eggert N-best
                  alignments and progressive multiple alignment. We
                  evaluate the performance of the algorithm on test
                  examples from the RFAM database. CONCLUSION: A
                  program, Stemloc, that implements these algorithms
                  for efficient RNA sequence alignment and structure
                  prediction is available under the GNU General Public

                  identification of novel nmRNAs in genomes of model
                  organisms is severely restricted owing to their lack
                  of an open reading frame. Hence, we describe
                  experimental approaches for their identification by
                  generating cDNA libraries derived from nmRNAs for
                  which we coined the term experimental RNomics. Two
                  different procedures are introduced for cDNA library
                  construction. First, we describe the construction of
                  a general purpose cDNA library from sized RNA
                  fractions. Second, we introduce a more specialized
                  RNomics strategy employing this approach to generate
                  a cDNA library from a specific abundant class of
                  nmRNAs. This is illustrated using as a paradigm the
                  two families of small nucleolar RNAs that guide
                  modification of nucleotides in rRNAs or spliceosomal
                  RNAs small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) by short antisense
                  elements complementary to the modification
                  site. Following the identification of novel members
                  from the class of small nuclear RNAs by experimental
                  RNomics, we demonstrate how their target sequences
                  in rRNAs or snRNAs can be identified.}

                  specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or
                  inhibit translation. The specific function of most
                  mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted
                  target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human
                  gene transcripts for all currently known 218
                  mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused
                  experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes with
                  miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about
                  250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals
                  and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes
                  sequence complementarity using position-specific
                  rules and relies on strict requirements of
                  interspecies conservation. Experimental support for
                  the validity of the method comes from known targets
                  and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in
                  mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental
                  retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent
                  with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as
                  sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of
                  ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated
                  messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include
                  mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components
                  of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved
                  in translational regulation, as well as components
                  of the ubiquitin machinery, representing novel
                  feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed
                  information about target genes, target processes,
                  and open-source software for target prediction
                  (miRanda) is available at
                  http://www.microrna.org. Our analysis suggests that
                  miRNA genes, which are about 1\% of all human genes,
                  regulate protein production for 10\% or more of all

                  across approximately 30\% of the human genome and
                  elucidated the structures of several hundred novel
                  transcripts. In this report, we describe a novel
                  combination of techniques including the rapid
                  amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and tiling array
                  technologies that was used to further characterize
                  transcripts in the human transcriptome. This
                  technical approach allows for several important
                  pieces of information to be gathered about each
                  array-detected transcribed region, including strand
                  of origin, start and termination positions, and the
                  exonic structures of spliced and unspliced coding
                  and noncoding RNAs. In this report, the structures
                  of transcripts from 14 transcribed loci,
                  representing both known genes and unannotated
                  transcripts taken from the several hundred randomly
                  selected unannotated transcripts described in our
                  previous work are represented as examples of the
                  complex organization of the human transcriptome. As
                  a consequence of this complexity, it is not unusual
                  that a single base pair can be part of an intricate
                  network of multiple isoforms of overlapping sense
                  and antisense transcripts, the majority of which are
                  unannotated. Some of these transcripts follow the
                  canonical splicing rules, whereas others combine the
                  exons of different genes or represent other types of
                  noncanonical transcripts. These results have
                  important implications concerning the correlation of
                  genotypes to phenotypes, the regulation of complex
                  interlaced transcriptional patterns, and the
                  definition of a gene.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: A new hidden Markov model method
                  (SAM-T98) for finding remote homologs of protein
                  sequences is described and evaluated. The method
                  begins with a single target sequence and iteratively
                  builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence
                  and homologs found using the HMM for database
                  search. SAM-T98 is also used to construct model
                  libraries automatically from sequences in structural
                  databases. METHODS: We evaluate the SAM-T98 method
                  with four datasets. Three of the test sets are
                  fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers
                  are determined by structural similarity. The fourth
                  uses a curated database. The method is compared
                  against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST, a
                  two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST
                  instead of FASTA. RESULTS: SAM-T98 had the fewest
                  errors in all tests-dramatically so for the
                  fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point
                  on the SCOP (Structural Classification of
                  Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98 got 880 true
                  positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST got
                  533 true positives with 71 false positives, and
                  WU-BLASTP got 353 true positives with 24 false
                  positives. The method is optimized to recognize
                  superfamilies, and would require parameter
                  adjustment to be used to find family or fold
                  relationships. One key to the performance of the HMM
                  method is a new score-normalization technique that
                  compares the score to the score with a reversed
                  model rather than to a uniform null
                  model. AVAILABILITY: A World Wide Web server, as
                  well as information on obtaining the Sequence
                  Alignment and Modeling (SAM) software suite, can be

                  three related species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and
                  S. bayanus). We first aligned the genomes and
                  characterized their evolution, defining the regions
                  and mechanisms of change. We then developed methods
                  for direct identification of genes and regulatory
                  motifs. The gene analysis yielded a major revision
                  to the yeast gene catalogue, affecting approximately
                  15\% of all genes and reducing the total count by
                  about 500 genes. The motif analysis automatically
                  identified 72 genome-wide elements, including most
                  known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs. We
                  inferred a putative function for most of these
                  motifs, and provided insights into their
                  combinatorial interactions. The results have

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: For many RNA molecules, secondary
                  structure rather than primary sequence is the
                  evolutionarily conserved feature. No programs have
                  yet been published that allow searching a sequence
                  database for homologs of a single RNA molecule on
                  the basis of secondary structure. RESULTS: We have
                  developed a program, RSEARCH, that takes a single
                  RNA sequence with its secondary structure and
                  utilizes a local alignment algorithm to search a
                  database for homologous RNAs. For this purpose, we
                  have developed a series of base pair and single
                  nucleotide substitution matrices for RNA sequences
                  called RIBOSUM matrices. RSEARCH reports the
                  statistical confidence for each hit as well as the
                  structural alignment of the hit. We show several
                  examples in which RSEARCH outperforms the primary
                  sequence search programs BLAST and SSEARCH. The
                  primary drawback of the program is that it is
                  slow. The C code for RSEARCH is freely available
                  from our lab's website. CONCLUSION: RSEARCH
                  outperforms primary sequence programs in finding
                  homologs of structured RNA sequences.}

  abstract =	 {ERPIN is an RNA motif identification program that
                  takes an RNA sequence alignment as an input and
                  identifies related sequences using a profile-based
                  dynamic programming algorithm. ERPIN differs from
                  other RNA motif search programs in its ability to
                  capture subtle biases in the training set and
                  produce highly specific and sensitive searches,
                  while keeping CPU requirements at a practical
                  level. In its latest version, ERPIN also computes
                  E-values, which tell biologists how likely they are
                  to encounter a specific sequence match by chance-a
                  useful indication of biological significance. We
                  present here the ERPIN online search interface
                  (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/erpin/). This web server
                  automatically performs ERPIN searches for different
                  RNA genes or motifs, using predefined training sets
                  and search parameters. With a couple of clicks,
                  users can analyze an entire bacterial genome or a
                  genomic segment of up to 5Mb for the presence of
                  tRNAs, 5S rRNAs, SRP RNA, C/D box snoRNAs,
                  hammerhead motifs, miRNAs and other motifs. Search
                  results are displayed with sequence, score,
                  position, E-value and secondary structure
                  graphics. An example of a complete genome scan is
                  provided, as well as an evaluation of run times and

                  there have been several recent attempts to identify
                  novel NATs. To date, approximately 2500 mammalian
                  NATs have been found, indicating that antisense
                  transcription might be a common mechanism of

                  increasingly diverse ways in which antisense

                  method to calculate two quantitative measures, NRd
                  and Stscr, for estimating the uniqueness of an RNA
                  secondary structure. NRd is a normalized score based
                  on evaluating how different a natural RNA structure
                  is from those predicted for its randomly shuffled
                  variants. The lower the score NRd the more well

                  ordered conformations and they are uniquely folded

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Growing evidence demonstrates that local
                  well-ordered structures are closely correlated with
                  cis-acting elements in the post-transcriptional
                  regulation of gene expression. The prediction of a
                  well-ordered folding sequence (WFS) in genomic
                  sequences is very helpful in the determination of
                  local RNA elements with structure-dependent
                  functions in mRNAs. RESULTS: In this study, the
                  quality of local WFS is assessed by the energy
                  difference (E(diff)) between the free energies of
                  the global minimal structure folded in the segment
                  and its corresponding optimal restrained structure
                  (ORS). The ORS is an optimal structure under the
                  condition in which none of the base-pairs in the
                  global minimal structure is allowed to form. Those
                  WFSs in HIV-1 mRNA, various ferritin mRNAs and
                  genomic sequences containing let-7 RNA gene were
                  searched by a novel method, ed\_scan. Our results
                  indicate that the detected WFSs are coincident with
                  known Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA,
                  iron-responsive elements in ferritin mRNAs and small
                  let-7 RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis
                  briggsae and Drosophila melanogaster genomic
                  sequences. Statistical significance of the WFS is
                  addressed by a quantitative measure Zscr(e) that is
                  a z-score of E(diff) and extensive random
                  simulations. We suggest that WFSs with high
                  statistical significance have structural roles
                  involving their sequence information. AVAILABILITY:

                  secondary structure. There are two new features in
                  this program. (i) To get vector speeds on a vector
                  pipeline machine (such as Cray X-MP/24) we have
                  vectorized the secondary structure dynamic
                  algorithm. (ii) The statistical significance of a
                  locally 'optimal' secondary structure is assessed by
                  a Monte Carlo method. The results can be depicted
                  graphically including profiles of the stability of
                  local secondary structures and the distribution of
                  the potentially significant secondary structures in
                  the RNA molecules. Interesting regions where both
                  the potentially significant secondary structures and
                  'open' structures (single-stranded coils) occur can
                  be identified by the plots mentioned
                  above. Furthermore, the speed of the vectorized code
                  allows repeated Monte Carlo simulations with
                  different overlapping window sizes. Thus, the
                  optimal size of the significant secondary structure
                  occurring in the interesting region can be assessed
                  by repeating the Monte Carlo simulation. The power
                  of the program is demonstrated in the analysis of
                  local secondary structures of human T-cell
                  lymphotrophic virus type III (HIV).}

  abstract =	 "{Although inhibition of RNA interference (RNAi) by
                  plant virus proteins has been shown to enhance viral
                  replication and pathogenesis in plants, no viral
                  gene product has as yet been shown to inhibit RNAi
                  in vertebrate cells. Here, we present evidence
                  demonstrating that the highly structured
                  approximately 160-nucleotide adenoviral VA1
                  noncoding RNA can inhibit RNAi at physiological
                  levels of expression. VA1, which is expressed at
                  very high levels in adenovirus-infected cells,
                  potently inhibited RNAi induced by short hairpin
                  RNAs (shRNAs) or human microRNA precursors but did
                  not affect RNAi induced by artificial short
                  interfering RNA duplexes. Inhibition appeared to be
                  due both to inhibition of nuclear export of shRNA or
                  premicro-RNA precursors, competition for the
                  Exportin 5 nuclear export factor, and inhibition of
                  Dicer function by direct binding of Dicer. Together,
                  these data argue that adenovirus infection can
                  result in inhibition of RNAi and identify VA1 RNA as
                  the first viral gene product able to inhibit RNAi in
                  human cells.}",

                  functional activities. Many of these RNA structures
                  are assembled from a collection of RNA structural
                  motifs. These basic building blocks are used
                  repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form
                  different RNA types and define their unique
                  structural and functional properties. Identification
                  of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore
                  enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help
                  associate elements of RNA structure with functional
                  and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a
                  computer program that can describe an RNA structural
                  element of any complexity and then search any
                  nucleotide sequence database, including the complete
                  prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these
                  structural elements. Here we describe in detail a
                  new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif,
                  and demonstrate its utility with some motif search
                  examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search
                  tools in two important aspects: first, the structure
                  definition language is more flexible and can specify
                  any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif
                  provides a user controlled scoring section that can
                  be used to add capabilities that patterns alone
                  cannot provide.}

  abstract =	 {Comparative sequence analysis has become an
                  essential component of studies aiming to elucidate
                  genome function. The increasing availability of
                  genomic sequences from multiple vertebrates is
                  creating the need for computational methods that can
                  detect highly conserved regions in a robust
                  fashion. Towards that end, we are developing
                  approaches for identifying sequences that are
                  conserved across multiple species; we call these
                  \&quot;Multi-species Conserved Sequences\&quot; (or
                  MCSs). Here we report two strategies for MCS
                  identification, demonstrating their ability to
                  detect virtually all known actively conserved
                  sequences (specifically, coding sequences) but very
                  little neutrally evolving sequence (specifically,
                  ancestral repeats). Importantly, we find that a
                  substantial fraction of the bases within MCSs
                  (approximately 70\%) resides within non-coding
                  regions; thus, the majority of sequences conserved
                  across multiple vertebrate species has no known
                  function. Initial characterization of these MCSs has
                  revealed sequences that correspond to clusters of
                  transcription factor-binding sites, non-coding RNA
                  transcripts, and other candidate functional
                  elements. Finally, the ability to detect MCSs
                  represents a valuable metric for assessing the
                  relative contribution of a species' sequence to
                  identifying genomic regions of interest, and our
                  results indicate that the currently available genome
                  sequences are insufficient for the comprehensive
                  identification of MCSs in the human genome.}

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Genomes from all organisms known to date
                  express two types of RNA molecules: messenger RNAs
                  (mRNAs), which are translated into proteins, and
                  non-messenger RNAs, which function at the RNA level
                  and do not serve as templates for
                  translation. RESULTS: We have generated a
                  specialized cDNA library from Arabidopsis thaliana
                  to investigate the population of small non-messenger
                  RNAs (snmRNAs) sized 50-500 nt in a plant. From this
                  library, we identified 140 candidates for novel
                  snmRNAs and investigated their expression,
                  abundance, and developmental regulation. Based on
                  conserved sequence and structure motifs, 104 snmRNA
                  species can be assigned to novel members of known
                  classes of RNAs (designated Class I snmRNAs),
                  namely, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 7SL RNA, U
                  snRNAs, as well as a tRNA-like RNA. For the first
                  time, 39 novel members of H/ACA box snoRNAs could be
                  identified in a plant species. Of the remaining 36
                  snmRNA candidates (designated Class II snmRNAs), no
                  sequence or structure motifs were present that would
                  enable an assignment to a known class of RNAs. These
                  RNAs were classified based on their location on the
                  A. thaliana genome. From these, 29 snmRNA species
                  located to intergenic regions, 3 located to intronic
                  sequences of protein coding genes, and 4 snmRNA
                  candidates were derived from annotated open reading
                  frames. Surprisingly, 15 of the Class II snmRNA
                  candidates were shown to be tissue-specifically
                  expressed, while 12 are encoded by the mitochondrial
                  or chloroplast genome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has
                  identified 140 novel candidates for small
                  non-messenger RNA species in the plant A. thaliana
                  and thereby sets the stage for their functional
                  analysis.}

                  accommodate folding constraints determined by
                  chemical modification and to include free energy
                  increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they
                  are either adjacent or separated by a single
                  mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are
                  revised to account for recent experimental results
                  for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge,
                  internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the
                  applicability of this method, in vivo modification
                  was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli
                  and Candida albicans with
                  1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide
                  metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and
                  kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the
                  predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\%
                  for the E. coli sequence by using modification
                  constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained
                  87.5\% both with and without modification data. On
                  average, for these sequences and a set of 14
                  sequences with known secondary structure and
                  chemical modification data taken from the
                  literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to
                  76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects
                  improvement for three sequences that are predicted
                  with \&lt;40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics
                  alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical
                  modification constraints improves the average
                  accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences
                  with \&lt;6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures
                  predicted with constraints from chemical
                  modification contain on average 84\% of known
                  canonical base pairs.}

                  reported for RNA secondary structure prediction by
                  free energy minimization. Thermodynamic parameters
                  for the stabilities of secondary structure motifs
                  are revised to include expanded sequence dependence
                  as revealed by recent experiments. Additional
                  algorithmic improvements include reduced search time
                  and storage for multibranch loop free energies and
                  improved imposition of folding constraints. An
                  extended database of 151,503 nt in 955 structures?
                  determined by comparative sequence analysis was
                  assembled to allow optimization of parameters not
                  based on experiments and to test the accuracy of the
                  algorithm. On average, the predicted lowest free
                  energy structure contains 73 \% of known base-pairs
                  when domains of fewer than 700 nt are folded; this
                  compares with 64 \% accuracy for previous versions
                  of the algorithm and parameters. For a given
                  sequence, a set of 750 generated structures contains
                  one structure that, on average, has 86 \% of known
                  base-pairs. Experimental constraints, derived from
                  enzymatic and flavin mononucleotide cleavage,
                  improve the accuracy of structure predictions.}

                  is non-coding RNA. RNA-mediated gene regulation is
                  widespread in higher eukaryotes and complex genetic
                  phenomena like RNA interference, co-suppression,
                  transgene silencing, imprinting, methylation, and
                  possibly position-effect variegation and
                  transvection, all involve intersecting pathways
                  based on or connected to RNA signaling. I suggest
                  that the central dogma is incomplete, and that
                  intronic and other non-coding RNAs have evolved to
                  comprise a second tier of gene expression in
                  eukaryotes, which enables the integration and
                  networking of complex suites of gene
                  activity. Although proteins are the fundamental
                  effectors of cellular function, the basis of
                  eukaryotic complexity and phenotypic variation may
                  lie primarily in a control architecture composed of
                  a highly parallel system of trans-acting RNAs that
                  relay state information required for the
                  coordination and modulation of gene expression, via
                  chromatin remodeling, RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA and
                  RNA-protein interactions. This system has
                  interesting and perhaps informative analogies with
                  small world networks and dataflow computing.}

  abstract =	 {The central dogma of biology holds that genetic
                  information normally flows from DNA to RNA to
                  protein. As a consequence it has been generally
                  assumed that genes generally code for proteins, and
                  that proteins fulfil not only most structural and
                  catalytic but also most regulatory functions, in all
                  cells, from microbes to mammals. However, the latter
                  may not be the case in complex organisms. A number
                  of startling observations about the extent of
                  non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcription in the
                  higher eukaryotes and the range of genetic and
                  epigenetic phenomena that are RNA-directed suggests
                  that the traditional view of the structure of
                  genetic regulatory systems in animals and plants may
                  be incorrect. ncRNA dominates the genomic output of
                  the higher organisms and has been shown to control
                  chromosome architecture, mRNA turnover and the
                  developmental timing of protein expression, and may
                  also regulate transcription and alternative
                  splicing. This paper re-examines the available
                  evidence and suggests a new framework for
                  considering and understanding the genomic
                  programming of biological complexity, autopoietic
                  development and phenotypic variation.}

                  Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and
                  Paratyphi A (collectively referred to as SAL) and
                  the genome of the close outgroup Klebsiella
                  pneumoniae (KPN). There are at least 160 locations
                  where sequences of \&gt;400 bp are absent from ECO
                  but present in the genomes of all three SAL and 394
                  locations where sequences are present in ECO but
                  close homologs are absent in all SAL genomes. The
                  394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL
                  contain 1350 (30.6\%) of the 4405 ECO genes. Of
                  these, 1165 are missing from both SAL and KPN. Most
                  of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions
                  of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of
                  such genes. Among these regions were six that
                  included previously identified cryptic phage. A
                  hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that
                  differ between ECO and SAL can be inferred in some
                  cases by reference to the genome structure in KPN
                  and the more distant relative Yersinia
                  pestis. However, many changes between ECO and SAL
                  are concentrated in regions where all four genera
                  have a different structure. The rate of gene
                  insertion and deletion is sufficiently high in these
                  regions that the ancestral state of the ECO/SAL
                  lineage cannot be inferred from the present
                  data. The sequencing of other closely related
                  genomes, such as S.bongori or Citrobacter, may help
                  in this regard.}

                  selectively bind small molecules. In the past two
                  years, it has become clear that nature has already
                  devised its own aptamers that play important
                  regulatory roles. RNA sensors have been discovered
                  in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
                  that function as molecular switches in response to
                  direct binding of structurally diverse
                  metabolites. These natural RNA aptamers, called
                  'riboswitches', are imbedded in the leader sequences
                  of numerous metabolic genes. Riboswitches are able
                  to repress or activate their cognate genes at both
                  transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we
                  summarize the recent progress in the identification
                  and characterization of riboswitches and discuss
                  their evolution and distribution.}

  abstract =	 "{BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 to
                  approximately 25-nucleotides (nt) long and interact
                  with mRNAs to trigger either translational
                  repression or RNA cleavage through RNA interference
                  (RNAi), depending on the degree of complementarity
                  with the target mRNAs. Our recent study has shown
                  that HIV-1 nef dsRNA from AIDS patients who are
                  long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) inhibited the
                  transcription of HIV-1. RESULTS: Here, we show the
                  possibility that nef-derived miRNAs are produced in
                  HIV-1 persistently infected cells. Furthermore, nef
                  short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that corresponded to a
                  predicted nef miRNA (approximately 25 nt, miR-N367)
                  can block HIV-1 Nef expression in vitro and the
                  suppression by shRNA/miR-N367 would be related with
                  low viremia in an LTNP (15-2-2). In the 15-2-2 model
                  mice, the weight loss, which may be rendered by nef
                  was also inhibited by shRNA/miR-N367 corresponding
                  to suppression of nef expression in
                  vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nef/U3
                  miRNAs produced in HIV-1-infected cells may suppress
                  both Nef function and HIV-1 virulence through the
                  RNAi pathway.}",

  abstract =	 {The recent interest sparked due to the discovery of
                  a variety of functions for non-coding RNA molecules
                  has highlighted the need for suitable tools for the
                  analysis and the comparison of RNA sequences. Many
                  trans-acting non-coding RNA genes and cis-acting RNA
                  regulatory elements present motifs, conserved both
                  in structure and sequence, that can be hardly
                  detected by primary sequence analysis alone. We
                  present an algorithm that takes as input a set of
                  unaligned RNA sequences expected to share a common
                  motif, and outputs the regions that are most
                  conserved throughout the sequences, according to a
                  similarity measure that takes into account both the
                  sequence of the regions and the secondary structure
                  they can form according to base-pairing and
                  thermodynamic rules. Only a single parameter is
                  needed as input, which denotes the number of
                  distinct hairpins the motif has to contain. No
                  further constraints on the size, number and position
                  of the single elements comprising the motif are
                  required. The algorithm can be split into two parts:
                  first, it extracts from each input sequence a set of
                  candidate regions whose predicted optimal secondary
                  structure contains the number of hairpins given as
                  input. Then, the regions selected are compared with
                  each other to find the groups of most similar ones,
                  formed by a region taken from each sequence. To
                  avoid exhaustive enumeration of the search space and
                  to reduce the execution time, a greedy heuristic is
                  introduced for this task. We present different
                  experiments, which show that the algorithm is
                  capable of characterizing and discovering known
                  regulatory motifs in mRNA like the iron responsive
                  element (IRE) and selenocysteine insertion sequence
                  (SECIS) stem-loop structures. We also show how it
                  can be applied to corrupted datasets in which a
                  motif does not appear in all the input sequences, as
                  well as to the discovery of more complex motifs in
                  the non-coding RNA.}

                  conserved helix 8 motif of SRP RNA is combined with
                  covariance models that are based on previously known
                  SRP RNA sequences. By screening available genomic
                  sequences we have identified a large number of novel
                  SRP RNA genes and we can account for at least one
                  gene in every genome that has been completely
                  sequenced. Novel bacterial RNAs include that of
                  Thermotoga maritima, which, unlike all other
                  non-gram-positive eubacteria, is predicted to have
                  an Alu domain. We have also found the RNAs of
                  Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus to have an
                  unusual UGAC tetraloop in helix 8 instead of the

                  reveals conserved sequence elements of the Alu
                  domain that aid in the analysis of these
                  RNAs. Analysis of the human genome reveals only two
                  likely genes, both on chromosome 14. Our method for
                  SRP RNA gene prediction is the first convenient tool

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Several results in the literature
                  suggest that biologically interesting RNAs have
                  secondary structures that are more stable than
                  expected by chance. Based on these observations, we
                  developed a scanning algorithm for detecting
                  noncoding RNA genes in genome sequences, using a
                  fully probabilistic version of the Zuker
                  minimum-energy folding algorithm. RESULTS:
                  Preliminary results were encouraging, but certain
                  anomalies led us to do a carefully controlled
                  investigation of this class of methods. Ultimately,
                  our results argue that for the probabilistic model
                  there is indeed a statistical effect, but it comes
                  mostly from local base-composition bias and not from
                  RNA secondary structure. For the thermodynamic
                  implementation (which evaluates statistical
                  significance by doing Monte Carlo shuffling in
                  fixed-length sequence windows, thus eliminating the
                  base-composition effect) the signals for noncoding
                  RNAs are still usually indistinguishable from noise,
                  especially when certain statistical artifacts
                  resulting from local base-composition inhomogeneity
                  are taken into account. We conclude that although a
                  distinct, stable secondary structure is undoubtedly
                  important in most noncoding RNAs, the stability of
                  most noncoding RNA secondary structures is not
                  sufficiently different from the predicted stability
                  of a random sequence to be useful as a general
                  genefinding approach.}

                  distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA
                  (ncRNA) gene sequences have no obvious inherent
                  statistical biases [3]. Thus, genome sequence
                  analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes, but any
                  novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we
                  describe a computational comparative genomic screen
                  for ncRNA genes. The key idea is to distinguish
                  conserved RNA secondary structures from a background
                  of other conserved sequences using probabilistic
                  models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise
                  sequence alignments. We report the first
                  whole-genome screen for ncRNA genes done with this
                  method, in which we applied it to the
                  \&quot;intergenic\&quot; spacers of Escherichia coli
                  using comparative sequence data from four related
                  bacteria. Starting from \&gt;23,000 conserved
                  interspecies pairwise alignments, the screen
                  predicted 275 candidate structural RNA loci. A
                  sample of 49 candidate loci was assayed
                  experimentally. At least 11 loci expressed small,
                  apparently noncoding RNA transcripts of unknown
                  function. Our computational approach may be used to
                  discover structural ncRNA genes in any genome for
                  which appropriate comparative genome sequence data
                  are available.}

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts
                  that exert their function without ever producing
                  proteins. Noncoding RNA gene sequences do not have
                  strong statistical signals, unlike protein coding
                  genes. A reliable general purpose computational
                  genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has been
                  elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence
                  analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural
                  RNA genes. The key idea is to test the pattern of
                  substitutions observed in a pairwise alignment of
                  two homologous sequences. A conserved coding region
                  tends to show a pattern of synonymous substitutions,
                  whereas a conserved structural RNA tends to show a
                  pattern of compensatory mutations consistent with
                  some base-paired secondary structure. We formalize
                  this intuition using three probabilistic
                  \&quot;pair-grammars\&quot;: a pair stochastic
                  context free grammar modeling alignments constrained
                  by structural RNA evolution, a pair hidden Markov
                  model modeling alignments constrained by coding
                  sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model
                  modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent
                  evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence
                  alignment (e.g. from a BLASTN comparison of two
                  related genomes) we classify the alignment into the
                  coding, RNA, or null class according to the
                  posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We
                  have implemented this approach as a program, QRNA,
                  which we consider to be a prototype structural
                  noncoding RNA genefinder. Tests suggest that this
                  approach detects noncoding RNA genes with a fair
                  degree of reliability.}

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Probabilistic models for sequence
                  comparison (such as hidden Markov models and pair
                  hidden Markov models for proteins and mRNAs, or
                  their context-free grammar counterparts for
                  structural RNAs) often assume a fixed degree of
                  divergence. Ideally we would like these models to be
                  conditional on evolutionary divergence
                  time. Probabilistic models of substitution events
                  are well established, but there has not been a
                  completely satisfactory theoretical framework for
                  modeling insertion and deletion events. RESULTS: I
                  have developed a method for extending standard
                  Markov substitution models to include gap
                  characters, and another method for the evolution of
                  state transition probabilities in a probabilistic
                  model. These methods use instantaneous rate matrices
                  in a way that is more general than those used for
                  substitution processes, and are sufficient to
                  provide time-dependent models for standard linear
                  and affine gap penalties, respectively. Given a
                  probabilistic model, we can make all of its emission
                  probabilities (including gap characters) and all its
                  transition probabilities conditional on a chosen
                  divergence time. To do this, we only need to know
                  the parameters of the model at one particular
                  divergence time instance, as well as the parameters
                  of the model at the two extremes of zero and
                  infinite divergence. I have implemented these
                  methods in a new generation of the RNA genefinder
                  QRNA (eQRNA). CONCLUSION: These methods can be
                  applied to incorporate evolutionary models of
                  insertions and deletions into any hidden Markov
                  model or stochastic context-free grammar, in a pair
                  or profile form, for sequence modeling.}

                  and function of the signal recognition particle

                  signal sequences as they emerge from the
                  ribosome. SRPDB provides alphabetically and
                  phylogenetically ordered lists of SRP RNA and SRP
                  protein sequences. The SRP RNA alignment emphasizes
                  base pairs supported by comparative sequence
                  analysis to derive accurate SRP RNA secondary
                  structures for each species. This release includes a
                  total of 181 SRP RNA sequences, 7 protein SRP9, 11
                  SRP14, 31 SRP19, 113 SRP54 (Ffh), 9 SRP68 and 12

                  total of 99 entries). Additional data are provided

                  results of testing snoGPS on the budding yeast
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Six candidate snoRNAs were
                  verified as novel RNA transcripts, and five of these
                  were verified as guides for pseudouridine formation
                  at specific sites in ribosomal RNA. We also
                  predicted 14 new base-pairings between snoRNAs and
                  known pseudouridine sites in S.cerevisiae rRNA, 12
                  of which were verified by gene disruption and loss
                  of the cognate pseudouridine site. Our findings
                  include the first prediction and verification of
                  snoRNAs that guide pseudouridine modification at
                  more than two sites. With this work, 41 of the 44
                  known pseudouridine modifications in S.cerevisiae
                  rRNA have been linked with a verified snoRNA,
                  providing the most complete accounting of the H/ACA
                  snoRNAs that guide pseudouridylation in any
                  species.}

                  number of structures. Frequencies of structures are
                  highly non-uniform and follow a generalized form of

                  conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using
                  genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate
                  species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu
                  rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed
                  with multiple alignments of four insect species
                  (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae),
                  two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of
                  Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified
                  with a computer program called phastCons, which is
                  based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov
                  model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a
                  phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject
                  to constraints designed to calibrate the model
                  across species groups, and then predicting conserved
                  elements based on this model. The predicted elements
                  cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending
                  on the details of the calibration procedure) and
                  substantially higher fractions of the more compact
                  Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis
                  elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae
                  (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in
                  order of increasing genome size and general
                  biological complexity, increasing fractions of
                  conserved bases are found to lie outside of the
                  exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups,
                  the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by
                  log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases
                  long. These elements share certain properties with
                  ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer
                  and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes
                  of somewhat different functional categories. In
                  vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of
                  regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and
                  megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved
                  noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong
                  statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA
                  secondary structure.}

                  repeats. These repeat-derived microRNAs arise from
                  conventional precursor hairpins and are distinct
                  from the rasiRNAs, which appear to be processed from
                  long double-stranded RNA precursors. The insertion
                  of transposable elements into new genomic sites
                  appears to be one of the driving-forces that create
                  new microRNAs during mammalian evolution. Two of the
                  LINE-2-derived microRNAs exhibit perfect
                  complementarity to a large family of mRNA and EST
                  transcripts that contain portions of MIR and other
                  LINE-2 elements in their 3'-untranslated regions.}

  abstract =	 {The soil nematodes Caenorhabditis briggsae and
                  Caenorhabditis elegans diverged from a common
                  ancestor roughly 100 million years ago and yet are
                  almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the same
                  chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy
                  the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for
                  this striking conservation of structure and
                  function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome
                  to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the
                  finished C. elegans sequence. We predict
                  approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the
                  C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in
                  C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans
                  orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly
                  detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately
                  800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in
                  C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs
                  (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two
                  species. The two genomes exhibit extensive
                  colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to
                  be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the
                  centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of
                  C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae,
                  with the arrangement of genes being preserved in
                  96\% of cases. The difference in size between the
                  C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and
                  C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely
                  due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for
                  22.4\% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to
                  16.5\% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat
                  families are shared, suggesting that most were
                  acquired after the two species diverged or are
                  undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the
                  C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169
                  protein families of two or more members. Most of
                  these are shared between the two species, but some
                  appear to be expanding or contracting, and there
                  seem to be as many as several hundred novel
                  C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft
                  sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the
                  C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to
                  C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new
                  C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the
                  two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary
                  forces that mold nematode genomes.}

                  RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been
                  identified as sequence-specific posttranscriptional
                  regulators of gene expression. siRNA and miRNA are
                  incorporated into related RNA-induced silencing
                  complexes (RISCs), termed siRISC and miRISC,

                  and miRISC are functionally interchangeable and
                  target specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational
                  repression, depending on the extent of sequence
                  complementarity between the small RNA and its
                  target. Emerging evidence indicates, however, that
                  siRISC and miRISC are distinct complexes that
                  regulate mRNA stability and translation. The
                  assembly of RISCs can be traced from the biogenesis
                  of the small RNA molecules and the recruitment of
                  these RNAs by the RISC loading complex (RLC) to the
                  transition of the RLC into the active RISC. Target
                  recognition by the RISC can then take place through
                  different interacting modes.}

                  different organisms represents a central focus of
                  contemporary genome analysis. Comparative analyses
                  of vertebrate sequences can identify coding and
                  conserved non-coding regions, including regulatory
                  elements, and provide insight into the forces that
                  have rendered modern-day genomes. As a complement to
                  whole-genome sequencing efforts, we are sequencing
                  and comparing targeted genomic regions in multiple,
                  evolutionarily diverse vertebrates. Here we report
                  the generation and analysis of over 12 megabases
                  (Mb) of sequence from 12 species, all derived from
                  the genomic region orthologous to a segment of about
                  1.8 Mb on human chromosome 7 containing ten genes,
                  including the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis. These
                  sequences show conservation reflecting both
                  functional constraints and the neutral mutational
                  events that shaped this genomic region. In
                  particular, we identify substantial numbers of
                  conserved non-coding segments beyond those
                  previously identified experimentally, most of which
                  are not detectable by pair-wise sequence comparisons
                  alone. Analysis of transposable element insertions
                  highlights the variation in genome dynamics among
                  these species and confirms the placement of rodents

                  multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly
                  improved for the alignment of divergent protein
                  sequences. Firstly, individual weights are assigned
                  to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to
                  down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight
                  the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid
                  substitution matrices are varied at different
                  alignment stages according to the divergence of the
                  sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific
                  gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in
                  hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential
                  loop regions rather than regular secondary
                  structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments
                  where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced
                  gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new
                  gaps at these positions. These modifications are
                  incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is

                  Chicken Embryo Lethal Orphan (CELO) has two terminal
                  regions without detectable homology in mammalian
                  adenoviruses that are left without annotation in the
                  initial analysis. Since adenoviruses have been a
                  rich source of new insights into molecular cell
                  biology and practical applications of CELO as gene a
                  delivery vector are being considered, this genome
                  appeared worth revisiting. We conducted a systematic
                  reannotation and in-depth sequence analysis of the
                  CELO genome. RESULTS: We describe a strongly
                  diverged paralogous cluster including ORF-2, ORF-12,
                  ORF-13, and ORF-14 with an ATPase/helicase domain
                  most likely acquired from adeno-associated
                  parvoviruses. None of these ORFs appear to have
                  retained ATPase/helicase function and alternative
                  functions (e.g. modulation of gene expression during
                  the early life-cycle) must be considered in an
                  adenoviral context. Further, we identified a cluster
                  of three putative type-1-transmembrane glycoproteins
                  with IG-like domains (ORF-9, ORF-10, ORF-11) which
                  are good candidates to substitute for the missing
                  immunomodulatory functions of mammalian
                  adenoviruses. ORF-16 (located directly adjacent)
                  displays distant homology to vertebrate
                  mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. Members of this family
                  are known to be involved in immuno-regulation and
                  similiar functions during CELO life cycle can be
                  considered for this ORF. Finally, we describe a
                  putative triglyceride lipase (merged ORF-18/19) with
                  additional domains, which can be expected to have
                  specific roles during the infection of birds, since
                  they are unique to avian adenoviruses and Marek's
                  disease-like viruses, a group of pathogenic avian
                  herpesviruses. CONCLUSIONS: We could characterize
                  most of the previously unassigned ORFs pointing to
                  functions in host-virus interaction. The results
                  provide new directives for rationally designed
                  experiments.}

                  have characteristic secondary structures, their free
                  energies are generally not statistically significant
                  enough to distinguish RNA genes from the genomic
                  background. Additional information is
                  required. Considering the wide availability of new
                  genomic data of closely related species, comparative
                  studies seem to be the most promising
                  approach. Here, we show that prediction of consensus
                  structures of aligned sequences can be a significant
                  measure to detect functional RNAs. We report a new
                  method to test multiple sequence alignments for the
                  existence of an unusually structured and conserved
                  fold. We show for alignments of six types of
                  well-known functional RNA that an energy score
                  consisting of free energy and a covariation term
                  significantly improves sensitivity compared to
                  single sequence predictions. We further test our
                  method on a number of non-coding RNAs from
                  Caenorhabditis elegans/Caenorhabditis briggsae and
                  seven Saccharomyces species. Most RNAs can be
                  detected with high significance. We provide a Perl
                  implementation that can be used readily to score
                  single alignments and discuss how the methods
                  described here can be extended to allow for
                  efficient genome-wide screens.}

                  suggests that they bear conserved biological
                  functions. However, sequencing of new miRNAs has not
                  always been accompanied by a search for orthologues
                  in other species. I report herein the results of a
                  systematic search for interspecies orthologues of
                  miRNA precursors, leading to the identification of
                  35 human and 45 mouse new putative miRNA
                  genes. MicroRNA tracks were written to visualize
                  miRNAs in human and mouse genomes on the UCSC Genome
                  Browser. Based on their localization, miRNA
                  precursors can be excised either from introns or
                  exons of mRNAs. When intronic miRNAs are antisense
                  to the apparent host gene, they appear to originate
                  from ill-characterized antisense transcription
                  units. Exonic miRNAs are, in general,
                  nonprotein-coding, poorly conserved genes in sense
                  orientation. In three cases, the excision of an
                  miRNA from a protein-coding mRNA might lead to the
                  degradation of the rest of the transcript. Moreover,
                  three new examples of miRNAs fully complementary to
                  an mRNA are reported. Among these, miR135a might
                  control the stability and/or translation of an
                  alternative form of the glycerate kinase mRNA by RNA
                  interference. I also discuss the presence of human
                  miRNAs in introns of paralogous genes and in miRNA
                  clusters.}

                  molecules not coding for proteins-are grouped into
                  hundreds of families of homologs. To find new
                  members of an ncRNA gene family in a large genome
                  database, covariance models (CMs) are a useful
                  statistical tool, as they use both sequence and RNA
                  secondary structure information. Unfortunately, CM
                  searches are slow. Previously, we introduced
                  'rigorous filters', which provably sacrifice none of
                  CMs' accuracy, although often scanning much
                  faster. A rigorous filter, using a profile hidden
                  Markov model (HMM), is built based on the CM, and
                  filters the genome database, eliminating sequences
                  that provably could not be annotated as
                  homologs. The CM is run only on the remainder. Some
                  biologically important ncRNA families could not be
                  scanned efficiently with this technique, largely due
                  to the significance of conserved secondary structure
                  relative to primary sequence in identifying these
                  families. Current heuristic filters are also
                  expected to perform poorly on such
                  families. RESULTS: By augmenting profile HMMs with
                  limited secondary structure information, we obtain
                  rigorous filters that accelerate CM searches for
                  virtually all known ncRNA families from the Rfam
                  Database and tRNA models in tRNAscan-SE. These
                  filters scan an 8 gigabase database in weeks instead
                  of years, and uncover homologs missed by heuristic
                  techniques to speed CM searches. AVAILABILITY:

                  structures. For a set of 46 mRNAs it is shown that

                  important when assessing the significance of

                  RNA secondary structure is known to depend on

                  secondary structures, like tRNAs, can be shown to
                  have predicted free energies indistinguishable from
                  randomized sequences. This suggests that the
                  predicted free energy is not always a good

                  limit. The algorithm is particularly fast in the
                  vicinity of the minimum free energy. This enables
                  the efficient approximation of statistical
                  quantities, such as the partition function or
                  measures for structural diversity. The density of
                  states at low energies and its associated structures
                  are crucial in assessing from a thermodynamic point
                  of view how well-defined the ground state is. We
                  demonstrate this by exploring the role of base
                  modification in tRNA secondary structures, both at
                  the level of individual sequences from Escherichia

                  the same tRNA structure. The two major conclusions
                  are that (1) base modification considerably sharpens
                  the definition of the ground state structure by
                  constraining energetically adjacent structures to be
                  similar to the ground state, and (2) sequences whose
                  ground state structure is thermodynamically well
                  defined show a significant tendency to buffer single
                  point mutations. This can have evolutionary
                  implications, since selection pressure to improve
                  the definition of ground states with biological
                  function may result in increased neutrality.}

  abstract =	 {We have earlier generated a mutant mouse in a course
                  of making a transgenic line that exhibited
                  interesting heterozygote phenotypes, which exhibited
                  failure to thrive, severe bone deformities, and
                  polycystic kidneys. This mutant mouse provided a
                  clue to uncover a unique role of expressed
                  pseudogenes. In this mutant the transgene was
                  integrated into the vicinity of the expressing
                  pseudogene of Makorin1 called Makorin1-p1. This
                  insertion reduced transcription of the Makorin1-p1,
                  resulting in destabilization of the Makorin1 mRNA in
                  trans via a cis-acting RNA decay element within the
                  5' region of Makorin1 that is homologous between
                  Makorin1 and Makorin1-p1. These findings demonstrate
                  a novel and specific regulatory role of an expressed
                  pseudogene as well as functional significance for
                  noncoding RNAs. Next, we developed an original
                  algorithm to determine how many pseudogenes are
                  expressed. Based on our examination 2-3\% of human
                  processed pseudogenes are expressed using the most
                  strict criteria. Interestingly, the mouse has a much
                  smaller proportion of expressed pseudogenes
                  (0.5-1\%). Pseudogenes are functionally less
                  constrained, and have accumulated more mutations
                  than translated genes. If they have some functions
                  in gene regulation, this property would allow more
                  rapid functional diversification than protein-coding
                  genes. In addition, some genetic phenomena that
                  exhibit incomplete penetrance might be attributed to
                  \&quot;mutation\&quot; or \&quot;variation\&quot; of
                  pseudogenes.}

  abstract =	 {By generating a specialised cDNA library from four
                  different developmental stages of Drosophila
                  melanogaster, we have identified 66 candidates for
                  small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) and have
                  confirmed their expression by northern blot
                  analysis. Thirteen of them were expressed at certain
                  stages of D.melanogaster development,
                  only. Thirty-five species belong to the class of
                  small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), divided into 15
                  members from the C/D subclass and 20 members from
                  the H/ACA subclass, which mostly guide
                  2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation,
                  respectively, of rRNA and snRNAs. These also include
                  two outstanding C/D snoRNAs, U3 and U14, both
                  functioning as pre-rRNA chaperones. Surprisingly,
                  the sequence of the Drosophila U14 snoRNA reflects a
                  major change of function of this snoRNA in Diptera
                  relative to yeast and vertebrates. Among the 22
                  snmRNAs lacking known sequence and structure motifs,
                  five were located in intergenic regions, two in
                  introns, five in untranslated regions of mRNAs,
                  eight were derived from open reading frames, and two
                  were transcribed opposite to an
                  intron. Interestingly, detection of two RNA species
                  from this group implies that certain snmRNA species
                  are processed from alternatively spliced
                  pre-mRNAs. Surprisingly, a few snmRNA sequences
                  could not be found on the published D.melanogaster
                  genome, which might suggest that more snmRNA genes
                  (as well as mRNAs) are hidden in unsequenced regions
                  of the genome.}

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Three different protein prenyltransferases (farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferases I and II) catalyze the attachment of prenyl lipid anchors 15 or 20 carbons long to the carboxyl termini of a variety of eukaryotic proteins. Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I both recognize a 'Ca1a2X' motif on their protein substrates; geranylgeranyltransferase II recognizes a different, non-CaaX motif. Each enzyme has two subunits. The genes encoding CaaX protein prenyltransferases are considerably longer than those encoding non-CaaX subunits, as a result of longer introns. Alternative splice forms are predicted to occur, but the extent to which each splice form is translated and the functions of the different resulting isoforms remain to be established. Farnesyltransferase-inhibitor drugs have been developed as anti-cancer agents and may also be able to treat several other diseases. The effects of these inhibitors are complicated, however, by the overlapping substrate specificities of geranylgeranyltransferase I and farnesyltransferase.}

This review analyzes the influence of distinct states of sequential posttranslational processing that can be obtained after single or double prenylation, reversible palmitoylation, proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminus and possible reversible carboxymethylation. This series of modifications, as well as the exact length of the prenyl anchor, are determinants in protein-membrane and specific protein-protein interactions of protein prenyltransferase substrates. Furthermore, the occurrence and distribution of pseudogenes of protein prenyltransferase subunits are discussed. Besides being developed as anti-cancer agents, prenyltransferase inhibitors are effective against an increasing number of parasitic diseases. Extensive screens for protein prenyltransferases in genomic data of fungal and protozoan pathogens unveil a series of new pharmacologic targets for prenyltransferase inhibition, including the parasites Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, Aspergillus nidulans, Pneumocystis carinii, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichinella spiralis and Cryptosporidium parvum.}
