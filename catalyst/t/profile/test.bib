  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable prediction of RNA-RNA binding energies is crucial,
	e.g. for the understanding on RNAi, microRNA-mRNA binding and antisense
	interactions. The thermodynamics of such RNA-RNA interactions can
	be understood as the sum of two energy contributions: (1) the energy
	necessary to 'open' the binding site and (2) the energy gained from
	hybridization. METHODS: We present an extension of the standard partition
	function approach to RNA secondary structures that computes the probabilities
	Pu[i, j] that a sequence interval [i, j] is unpaired. RESULTS: Comparison
	with experimental data shows that Pu[i, j] can be applied as a significant
	determinant of local target site accessibility for RNA interference
	(RNAi). Furthermore, these quantities can be used to rigorously determine
	binding free energies of short oligomers to large mRNA targets. The
	resource consumption is comparable with a single partition function
	computation for the large target molecule. We can show that RNAi
	efficiency correlates well with the binding energies of siRNAs to
	their respective mRNA target. AVAILABILITY: RNAup will be distributed

                  helix-loop-helix regulatory factors involved in controlling 
                  myogenesis. We here describe various protein complexes that 
                  increase the affinity of myogenin for DNA. We mixed an 
                  oligonucleotide containing a degenerate center large enough 
                  to accommodate multiple binding sites with crude myotube 
                  nuclear extracts and used cyclic amplification and selection 
                  of targets with an antimyogenin monoclonal antibody to 
                  isolate protein-DNA complexes. Since each cycle of selection 
                  results in the enrichment for the sequences with the highest 
                  affinity, we isolated multicomponent sites in which myogenin 
                  binding was increased by its interaction with other DNA 
                  binding proteins. Myogenin interacts with members of the 
                  nuclear factor 1 family, the muscle-specific factor 
                  myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor 2, and another 
                  factor, COMP1 (cooperates with myogenic proteins 1), that 
                  binds to the sequence TGATTGAC. Myogenin also exhibits 
                  cooperative binding with other proteins that recognize 
                  CANNTG motifs, and various constraints on spacing and 
                  orientation were observed. The application of this approach 
                  to other transcription factors should not only help identify 
                  the different functions of myogenin versus other members of 
                  the muscle basic helix-loop-helix regulatory family but also 
                  help define the general combinatorial mechanisms involved in 
                  eukaryotic gene regulation.}

                  the principal secretory product of the vertebrate thyroid, 
                  its essential metabolic and developmental effects are all 
                  mediated by 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), which is produced 
                  from the prohormone by 5'-deiodination. The type-I 
                  iodothyronine deiodinase, a thiol-requiring 
                  propylthiouracil-sensitive oxidoreductase, is found mainly 
                  in liver and kidney and provides most of the circulating 
                  T3(1) but so far this enzyme has not been purified. Using 
                  expression cloning in the Xenopus oocyte, we have isolated a 
                  2.1-kilobase complementary DNA for this deiodinase from a 
                  rat liver cDNA library. The kinetic properties of the 
                  protein expressed in transient assay systems, the tissue 
                  distribution of the messenger RNA, and its changes with 
                  thyroid status, all confirm its identity. We find that the 
                  mRNA for this enzyme contains a UGA codon for selenocysteine 
                  which is necessary for maximal enzyme activity. This 
                  explains why conversion of T4 to T3 is impaired in 
                  experimental selenium deficiency and identifies an essential 
                  role for this trace element in thyroid hormone action.}

                  primary sequence can be separated into two subproblems: 
                  generation of a library of possible folds and specification 
                  of a best fold given the library. A distance geometry 
                  procedure based on random pairwise metrization with good 
                  sampling properties was used to generate a library of 500 
                  possible structures for each of 11 small helical proteins. 
                  The input to distance geometry consisted of sets of 
                  restraints to enforce predicted helical secondary structure 
                  and a generic range of 5 to 11 A between predicted contact 
                  residues on all pairs of helices. For each of the 11 
                  targets, the resulting library contained structures with low 
                  RMSD versus the native structure. Near-native sampling was 
                  enhanced by at least three orders of magnitude compared to a 
                  random sampling of compact folds. All library members were 
                  scored with a combination of an all-atom distance-dependent 
                  function, a residue pair-potential, and a hydrophobicity 
                  function. In six of the 11 cases, the best-ranking fold was 
                  considered to be near native. Each library was also reduced 
                  to a final ab initio prediction via consensus distance 
                  geometry performed over the 50 best-ranking structures from 
                  the full set of 500. The consensus results were of generally 
                  higher quality, yielding six predictions within 6.5 A of the 
                  native fold. These favorable predictions corresponded to 
                  those for which the correlation between the RMSD and the 
                  scoring function were highest. The advantage of the reported 
                  methodology is its extreme simplicity and potential for 
                  including other types of structural restraints.}

                  transcriptional interference and even transcriptional 
                  initiation. However, how this occurs is poorly understood. 
                  Recently, in vivo analysis of transcriptional termination 
                  for the human beta-globin gene revealed a new 
                  phenomenon-co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). This primary 
                  cleavage event within beta-globin pre-messenger RNA, 
                  downstream of the poly(A) site, is critical for efficient 
                  transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II. Here we 
                  show that the CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene 
                  involves an RNA self-cleaving activity. We characterize the 
                  autocatalytic core of the CoTC ribozyme and show its 
                  functional role in efficient termination in vivo. The 
                  identified core CoTC is highly conserved in the 3' flanking 
                  regions of other primate beta-globin genes. Functionally, it 
                  resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes 
                  described for the protein-encoding genes from the 
                  myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum, 
                  indicating evolutionary conservation of this molecular 
                  process. We predict that regulated autocatalytic cleavage 
                  elements within pre-mRNAs may be a general phenomenon and 
                  that functionally it may provide the entry point for 
                  exonucleases involved in mRNA maturation, turnover and, in 
                  particular, transcriptional termination.}

  abstract = {In RNAi (RNA interference), siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) are loaded
	into the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which then mediates
	endonucleolytic cleavage of complementary target RNAs. Although RNAi
	has become one of the most powerful tools in molecular biology to
	assess gene function, there remains a great number of ineffective
	siRNAs. It is already known that the assembly and activation of RISC
	is a crucial determinant of RNAi activity, but downstream effects
	such as target accessibility have not been analysed extensively.
	Therefore we assessed the effect of target site accessibility and
	found that it significantly improves the potency of siRNAs. Similarly,
	miRNAs (microRNAs) act by repressing protein synthesis through imperfect
	base-pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs.
	We found that predicted target sites reside in regions of high accessibility
	and tested whether this criterion could be used in the search of
	functional miRNA targets. In addition, we performed reporter gene
	assays to test whether accessibility correlates with measured mRNA
	suppression levels. The results of our initial study suggest that
	secondary structures might add a so far underrepresented layer of
	complexity in the recognition of RNA targets by miRNAs.},

  abstract =	 {Transcription factor-induced DNA bending is important in 
                  determining local promoter architecture and it is thought to 
                  be a key determinant of their function. The human MADS-box 
                  transcription factors serum response factor and MEF2A 
                  exhibit different propensities to bend their binding sites. 
                  Here, we have investigated the ability of several family 
                  members from different species to bend DNA and the molecular 
                  mechanisms underlying this process. Differential DNA bending 
                  is observed in yeast and plant MADS-box proteins. Like 
                  MEF2A, the yeast proteins Rlm1 and Smp1 exhibit low DNA 
                  bending propensities. A comparison of serum response factor 
                  and SQUA reveals that the basic mechanisms of DNA bending 
                  appear to be conserved between these proteins, although 
                  several key differences do exist. In contrast to serum 
                  response factor, SQUA bends DNA in a DNA sequence-dependent 
                  manner. In both proteins, protein-DNA contacts made between 
                  residues in the beta-loop and the N-terminal end of the 
                  recognition helices in the MADS-box are the major 
                  determinants of DNA bending. However, although residues 
                  which are involved in DNA bending are predicted to be 
                  located in similar positions in their tertiary structures, 
                  different residues dictate bending by each protein. Further 
                  complexities are uncovered in the links between the DNA 
                  bending propensity and the binding specificity. In

                  stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. This common feature 
                  makes it difficult for signal peptide and transmembrane 
                  helix predictors to correctly assign identity to stretches 
                  of hydrophobic residues near the N-terminal methionine of a 
                  protein sequence. The inability to reliably distinguish 
                  between N-terminal transmembrane helix and signal peptide is 
                  an error with serious consequences for the prediction of 
                  protein secretory status or transmembrane topology. In this 
                  study, we report a new method for differentiating protein 
                  N-terminal signal peptides and transmembrane helices. Based 
                  on the sequence features extracted from hydrophobic regions 
                  (amino acid frequency, hydrophobicity, and the start 
                  position), we set up discriminant functions and examined 
                  them on non-redundant datasets with jackknife tests. This 
                  method can incorporate other signal peptide prediction 
                  methods and achieve higher prediction accuracy. For 
                  Gram-negative bacterial proteins, 95.7% of N-terminal signal 
                  peptides and transmembrane helices can be correctly 
                  predicted (coefficient 0.90). Given a sensitivity of 90%, 
                  transmembrane helices can be identified from signal peptides 
                  with a precision of 99% (coefficient 0.92). For eukaryotic 
                  proteins, 94.2% of N-terminal signal peptides and 
                  transmembrane helices can be correctly predicted with 
                  coefficient 0.83. Given a sensitivity of 90%, transmembrane 
                  helices can be identified from signal peptides with a 
                  precision of 87% (coefficient 0.85). The method can be used 
                  to complement current transmembrane protein prediction and 
                  signal peptide prediction methods to improve their 
                  prediction accuracies.}

	the mRNA, in microRNA target recognition. We experimentally show
	that mutations diminishing target accessibility substantially reduce
	microRNA-mediated translational repression, with effects comparable
	to those of mutations that disrupt sequence complementarity. We devise
	a parameter-free model for microRNA-target interaction that computes
	the difference between the free energy gained from the formation
	of the microRNA-target duplex and the energetic cost of unpairing
	the target to make it accessible to the microRNA. This model explains
	the variability in our experiments, predicts validated targets more
	accurately than existing algorithms, and shows that genomes accommodate
	site accessibility by preferentially positioning targets in highly
	accessible regions. Our study thus demonstrates that target accessibility
	is a critical factor in microRNA function.},

title = "{Structure and nucleic-acid binding of the Drosophila Argonaute 2 PAZ domain}",
abstract = "{RNA interference is a conserved mechanism that regulates gene expression in response to the presence of double-stranded (ds)RNAs. The RNase III-like enzyme Dicer first cleaves dsRNA into 21-23-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In the effector step, the multimeric RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) identifies messenger RNAs homologous to the siRNAs and promotes their degradation. The Argonaute 2 protein (Ago2) is a critical component of RISC. Both Argonaute and Dicer family proteins contain a common PAZ domain whose function is unknown. Here we present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Ago2 PAZ domain. This domain adopts a nucleic-acid-binding fold that is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues. The nucleic-acid-binding patch is located in a cleft between the surface of a central beta-barrel and a conserved module comprising strands beta3, beta4 and helix alpha3. Because critical structural residues and the binding surface are conserved, we suggest that PAZ domains in all members of the Argonaute and Dicer families adopt a similar fold with nucleic-acid binding function, and that this plays an important part in gene silencing.}",

  abstract =	 {Previously, we introduced a neural network system 
                  predicting locations of transmembrane helices (HTMs) based 
                  on evolutionary profiles (PHDhtm, Rost B, Casadio R, 
                  Fariselli P, Sander C, 1995, Protein Sci 4:521-533). Here, 
                  we describe an improvement and an extension of that system. 
                  The improvement is achieved by a dynamic programming-like 
                  algorithm that optimizes helices compatible with the neural 
                  network output. The extension is the prediction of topology 
                  (orientation of first loop region with respect to membrane) 
                  by applying to the refined prediction the observation that 
                  positively charged residues are more abundant in 
                  extra-cytoplasmic regions. Furthermore, we introduce a 
                  method to reduce the number of false positives, i.e., 
                  proteins falsely predicted with membrane helices. The 
                  evaluation of prediction accuracy is based on a 
                  cross-validation and a double-blind test set (in total 131 
                  proteins). The final method appears to be more accurate than 
                  other methods published: (1) For almost 89% (+/-3%) of the 
                  test proteins, all HTMs are predicted correctly. (2) For 
                  more than 86% (+/-3%) of the proteins, topology is predicted 
                  correctly. (3) We define reliability indices that correlate 
                  with prediction accuracy: for one half of the proteins, 
                  segment accuracy raises to 98%; and for two-thirds, accuracy 
                  of topology prediction is 95%. (4) The rate of proteins for 
                  which HTMs are predicted falsely is below 2% (+/-1%). 
                  Finally, the method is applied to 1,616 sequences of 
                  Haemophilus influenzae. We predict 19% of the genome 
                  sequences to contain one or more HTMs. This appears to be 
                  lower than what we predicted previously for the yeast VIII 
                  chromosome (about 25%).}

                  supramolecular systems based on micelles and
                  vesicles (or liposomes); the processes are related
                  to possible prebiotic transformations involving the
                  forerunners of biological cells. Here we construct
                  and study a kinetic model which describes both the
                  formation and self- reproduction oi vesicles. Until
                  now, a detailed mechanistic understanding of vesicle
                  formation has been lacking. Our approach is based on
                  a novel generalisation of the Becker- Doring cluster
                  equations which describe the stepwise growth and
                  fragmentation of vesicular structures. The
                  non-linear kinetic model we present is highly
                  complex and involves many microscopic processes;
                  however, by means of a systematic contraction of the
                  complete set of kinetic equations to the macroscopic
                  limit, me show that the model correctly captures the
                  experimentally observed behaviour. }

  abstract =	 "We explore the effect of dimensionality on the
                  nearest neighbor problem. We show that under a broad
                  set of conditions (much broader than independent and
                  identically distributed dimensions), as
                  dimensionality increases, the distance to the
                  nearest data point approaches the distance to the
                  farthest data point. To provide a practical
                  perspective, we present empirical results on both
                  real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that
                  this effect can occur for as few as 10-15
                  dimensions. These results should not be interpreted
                  to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never
                  meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying
                  some high-dimensional workloads for which this
                  effect does not occur. However, our results do
                  emphasize that the methodology used almost
                  universally in the database literature to evaluate
                  high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and
                  should be modified. In particular, most such
                  techniques proposed in the literature are not
                  evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are
                  evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor
                  is not meaningful. Often, even the reported
                  experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that
                  linear scan would outperform the techniques being
                  proposed on the workloads studied in high (10-15)

	and cost-effective approach to elucidate the transcriptome of an

	EST data management and analysis. The pipeline uses a 'distributed
	control approach' in which the most appropriate bioinformatics tools
	are implemented over different dedicated processors. Species-specific
	repeat masking and conceptual translation are in-built. ESTExplorer
	accepts a set of ESTs in FASTA format which can be analysed using
	programs selected by the user. After pre-processing and assembly,
	the dataset is annotated at the nucleotide and protein levels, following
	conceptual translation. Users may optionally provide ESTExplorer
	with assembled contigs for annotation purposes. Functionally annotated
	contigs/ESTs can be analysed individually. The overall outputs are
	gene ontologies, protein functional identifications in terms of mapping
	to protein domains and metabolic pathways. ESTExplorer has been applied
	successfully to annotate large EST datasets from parasitic nematodes
	and to identify novel genes as potential targets for parasite intervention.
	ESTExplorer runs on a Linux cluster and is freely available for the

Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity by
using a substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one
amino acid with another. The most widely used matrices are based on the
Dayhoff model of evolutionary rates. Using a different approach, we have
derived substitution matrices from about 2000 blocks of aligned sequence
segments characterizing more than 500 groups of related proteins. This led
to marked improvements in alignments and in searches using queries from
each of the groups.

Monitoring biocatalysed reactions and metabolic pathways using NMR
spectroscopy is of growing interest. As a non-invasive analytical method
providing simultaneous information about intracellular and extracellular
constituents, it is superior to other analytical techniques and has a wide
range of applications: kinetics and stoichiometrics of metabolic events,
metabolic fluxes and enzyme activities can be detected in situ or after
taking a sample from the biotransformation mixture. New NMR pulse
sequences provide even more valuable experiments in these fields. Research
topics range from the monitoring of polymer formation to fermentations
producing beverages or antibiotics. Routine monitoring of industrial
fermentations by NMR seems to be imminent.}

   abstract = {Some genes produce noncoding transcripts that function directly as structural, regulatory, or even catalytic RNAs [1, 2]. Unlike protein-coding genes, which can be detected as open reading frames with distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene sequences have no obvious inherent statistical biases [3]. Thus, genome sequence analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes, but any novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we describe a computational comparative genomic screen for ncRNA genes. The key idea is to distinguish conserved RNA secondary structures from a background of other conserved sequences using probabilistic models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise sequence alignments. We report the first whole-genome screen for ncRNA genes done with this method, in which we applied it to the \&quot;intergenic\&quot; spacers of Escherichia coli using comparative sequence data from four related bacteria. Starting from \&gt;23,000 conserved interspecies pairwise alignments, the screen predicted 275 candidate structural RNA loci. A sample of 49 candidate loci was assayed experimentally. At least 11 loci expressed small, apparently noncoding RNA transcripts of unknown function. Our computational approach may be used to discover structural ncRNA genes in any genome for which appropriate comparative genome sequence data are available.}

                  complexity of the human genome/proteome, we have 
                  systematically analyzed intron phase distributions in the 
                  coding sequence of human protein domains. We found that 
                  introns at the boundaries of domains show high excess of 
                  symmetrical phase combinations (i.e., 0-0, 1-1, and 2-2), 
                  whereas nonboundary introns show no excess symmetry. This 
                  suggests that exon shuffling has primarily involved 
                  rearrangement of structural and functional domains as a 
                  whole. Furthermore, we found that domains flanked by phase 1 
                  introns have dramatically expanded in the human genome due 
                  to domain shuffling and that 1-1 symmetrical domains and 
                  domain families are nonrandomly distributed with respect to 
                  their age. The predominance and extracellular location of 
                  1-1 symmetrical domains among domains specific to metazoans 
                  suggests that they are associated with the rise of 
                  multicellularity. On the other hand, 0-0 symmetrical domains 
                  tend to be over-represented among ancient protein domains 
                  that are shared between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
                  kingdoms, which is compatible with the suggestion of 
                  primordial domain shuffling in the progenote. To see whether 
                  the human data reflect general genomic patterns of 
                  metazoans, similar analyses were done for the nematode 
                  Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the C. elegans data 
                  generally concur with the human patterns, we identified 
                  fewer intron-bounded domains in this organism, consistent 
                  with the lower complexity of C. elegans genes. [The

	to avoid cross-hybridization of highly similar sequences. We developed
	an approach to determine the optimal number and length of gene-specific
	probes for accurate transcriptional profiling studies. The study
	surveyed probe lengths from 25 to 1000 nt. Long probes yield better
	signal intensity than short probes. The signal intensity of short
	probes can be improved by addition of spacers or using higher probe
	concentration for spotting. We also found that accurate gene expression
	measurement can be achieved with multiple probes per gene and fewer
	probes are needed if longer probes rather than shorter probes are
	used. Based on theoretical considerations that were confirmed experimentally,
	our results showed that 150mer is the optimal probe length for expression
	measurement. Gene-specific probes can be identified using a computational
	approach for 150mer probes and they can be treated like long c{DNA}
	probes in terms of the hybridization reaction for high sensitivity
	detection. Our experimental data also show that probes which do not
	generate good signal intensity give erroneous expression ratio measurement
	results. To use microarray probes without experimental validation,
	gene-specific probes approximately 150mer in length are necessary.
	However, shorter oligonucleotide probes also work well in gene expression
	analysis if the probes are validated by experimental selection or
	if multiple probes per gene are used for expression measurement.},

                  secondary structure of two or more nucleic acid molecules,

                  secondary structures of interacting RNA molecules drawn from 
                  the literature. Analysis of our tools on 17 sequences of up 
                  to 200 nucleotides that do not form pseudoknots shows that 
                  they have 79% accuracy, on average, for the minimum free

                  foldings is taken, the average accuracy increases to 91%. 
                  The accuracy decreases as the sequences increase in length

                  structure prediction, and the sub-optimal folding algorithm

                  between the pattern suggested by the fossil record

                  for plants, animals, fungi, and the deepest branches

                  place constraints on the increase in complexity

                  fungi or plants, (iv) diplomonads, euglenozoans, and

                  (supergene). Different time estimation methods
                  yielded similar results (within 5\%):
                  vertebrate-arthropod (964 million years ago, Ma),
                  Cnidaria-Bilateria (1,298 Ma), Porifera-Eumetozoa
                  (1,351 Ma), Pyrenomycetes-Plectomycetes (551 Ma),
                  Candida-Saccharomyces (723 Ma),
                  Hemiascomycetes-filamentous Ascomycota (982 Ma),
                  Basidiomycota-Ascomycota (968 Ma),
                  Mucorales-Basidiomycota (947 Ma), Fungi-Animalia
                  (1,513 Ma), mosses-vascular plants (707 Ma),
                  Chlorophyta-Tracheophyta (968 Ma),
                  Rhodophyta-Chlorophyta+Embryophyta (1,428 Ma),
                  Plantae-Animalia (1,609 Ma),
                  Alveolata-plants+animals+fungi (1,973 Ma),
                  Euglenozoa-plants+animals+fungi (1,961 Ma), and
                  Giardia-plants+animals+fungi (2,309 Ma). By
                  extrapolation, mitochondria arose approximately
                  2300-1800 Ma and plastids arose 1600-1500
                  Ma. Estimates of the maximum number of cell types of
                  common ancestors, combined with divergence times,
                  showed an increase from two cell types at 2500 Ma to
                  approximately 10 types at 1500 Ma and 50 cell types
                  at approximately 1000 Ma. CONCLUSIONS: The results
                  suggest that oxygen levels in the environment, and
                  the ability of eukaryotes to extract energy from
                  oxygen, as well as produce oxygen, were key factors
                  in the rise of complex multicellular
                  life. Mitochondria and organisms with more than 2-3
                  cell types appeared soon after the initial increase
                  in oxygen levels at 2300 Ma. The addition of
                  plastids at 1500 Ma, allowing eukaryotes to produce
                  oxygen, preceded the major rise in complexity.}",

Signal finding (pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences) is a
fundamental problem in both computer science and molecular biology with
important applications in locating regulatory sites and drug target
identification. Despite many studies, this problem is far from being
resolved: most signals in DNA sequences are so complicated that we don't
yet have good models or reliable algorithms for their recognition. We
complement existing statistical and machine learning approaches to this
problem by a combinatorial approach that proved to be successful in
identifying very subtle signals.}

	forms an RNA-RNA duplex with ptsG mRNA to exert its regulatory function.
	Specific single nucleotide substitutions around the Shine-Dalgarno
	(SD) sequence of ptsG completely eliminated SgrS action while compensatory
	mutations in SgrS restored it. A systematic mutational analysis of
	both ptsG and SgrS RNAs revealed that six base pairs around SD sequence
	of ptsG are particularly important for SgrS action. We also showed
	in vitro that SgrS forms a stable duplex with the ptsG mRNA, and

MOTIVATION: We extend the standard 'Sequence Logo' method of Schneider and
Stevens (Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 6097-6100, 1990) to incorporate prior
frequencies on the bases, allow for gaps in the alignments, and indicate
the mutual information of base-paired regions in RNA. RESULTS: Given an
alignment of RNA sequences with the base pairings indicated, the program
will calculate the information at each position, including the mutual
information of the base pairs, and display the results in a 'Structure
Logo'. Alignments without base pairing can also be displayed in a
'Sequence Logo', but still allowing gaps and incorporating prior
frequencies if desired. AVAILABILITY: The code is available from, and an
Internet server can be used to run the program at,

	for 68 different hybrid sequences (136 single-stranded oligonucleotides)

                  Alternative splicing is another means of evolutionary 
                  innovation in eukaryotes, which allows a single gene to 
                  encode functionally diverse proteins. We investigate a 
                  connection between these two evolutionary phenomena. For 
                  approximately 10% of the described cases of substitution 
                  alternative splicing, such that either one or another amino 
                  acid sequence is included into the protein, evidence of 
                  origin by tandem exon duplication was found. This is a 
                  conservative estimate because alternative exons are 
                  typically short and, on many occasions, duplicates may have 
                  diverged beyond recognition. Dating exon duplications 
                  through a combination of the available experimental data on 
                  alternative splicing in orthologous genes from different 
                  species and computational analysis indicates that most of 
                  the duplications antedate at least the radiation of 
                  mammalian orders or even the radiation of vertebrate 
                  classes. At present, tandem exon duplication is the only 
                  mechanism of evolution of substitution alternative splicing 
                  that can be specifically demonstrated. Along with gene 
                  duplication, this could be a major route for generating 
                  functional diversity during evolution of multicellular 
                  eukaryotes.}

	be the initiation site for the dimerization of the retroviral genomic
	RNA. The aim of this study is to check the stability in solution
	of different experimental dimeric structures available in the literature.
	Two kinds of dimer have been evidenced: an extended duplex looking
	like a double helix with two internal bulges and a kissing complex
	in which the monomers with a stem/loop conformation are linked by
	intermolecular loop-loop interactions. Two divergent experimental
	structures of the kissing complex from the Lai isolate are reported
	in the literature, one obtained from NMR (Mujeeb et al., Nature Structural
	Biology, 1998, Vol. 5, pp. 432-436) and the other one from x-ray
	crystallography (Ennifar et al., Nature Structural Biology, 2001,
	Vol. 8, pp. 1064-1068). A crystallographic structure of the Mal isolate
	was also reported (Ennifar et al., Nature Structure Biology, 2001,
	Vol. 8, pp. 1064-1068). Concerning the extended duplex, a NMR structure
	is available for Lai (Girard et al., Journal of Biomolecular Structure
	and Dynamics, 1999, Vol. 16, pp. 1145-1157) and a crystallographic
	structure for Mal (Ennifar et al., Structure, 1999, Vol. 7, pp. 1439-1449).
	Using a molecular dynamics technique, all these experimental structures
	have been simulated in solution with explicit water and counterions.
	We show that both extended duplex structures are stable. On the contrary,
	the crystallographic structures of the Lai and Mal kissing complexes
	are rapidly destabilized in aqueous environment. Finally, the NMR
	structure of the Lai loop-loop kissing complex remains globally stable
	over a 20 ns MD simulation, although large rearrangements occur at
	the level of the stem/loop junctions that are flexible, as shown
	from free energy calculations. These results are compared to electrophoresis
	experiments on dimer formation.},

                  human FGF receptor 1 (FGFR 1) gene (flg). We found three 
                  alternative exons encoding a portion of the third

                  secreted form of FGFR 1. The other two encode sequences that 
                  are likely part of transmembrane forms of FGFR 1. One of 
                  these forms has not been previously reported in published 
                  cDNAs. Also, we have determined the structural organization 
                  of a portion of the human FGFR 2 gene (bek) and found a 
                  similar arrangement of alternative exons for the third 
                  Ig-like domain. The arrangement of these genes suggests that

                  secreted FGF receptors as well as the expression of at least 
                  two distinct membrane-spanning forms of the FGF receptors. 
                  The diverse forms appear to be generated by alternative

                  Surveying sequence and structure-based methods for 
                  predicting TFBSs, we conclude that in order to achieve a 
                  sound and specific method applicable on genomic sequences it 
                  is desirable and important to bring these two approaches

	It was further determined that the addition of a loop score combining

	their cognate miRNAs significantly decreased the false positive rates

	In C. elegans, two key genes in the heterochronic pathway, lin-4

	not translated into protein. These stRNAs exert negative post-transcriptional
	regulation by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated
	regions of their target genes. stRNAs are transcribed as longer precursor
	RNAs that are processed by the RNase Dicer/DCR-1 and members of the
	RDE-1/AGO1 family of proteins, which are better known for their roles
	in RNA interference (RNAi). However, stRNA function appears unrelated
	to RNAi. Both sequence and temporal regulation of let-7 stRNA is
	conserved in other animal species suggesting that this is an evolutionarily
	ancient gene. Indeed, C. elegans, Drosophila and humans encode at
	least 86 other RNAs with similar structural features to lin-4 and
	let-7. We postulate that other small non-coding RNAs may function
	as stRNAs to control temporal identity during development in C. elegans

                  explored four complementary approaches for
                  extracting gene and protein synonyms from text,
                  namely the unsupervised, partially supervised, and

                  alternatives over an archive of biological journal

                  techniques could be a valuable supplement to

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional
                  RNAs, most prominently the miRNAs have been
                  discovered, strongly suggesting that further types
                  of functional RNAs are still hidden in the recently
                  completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques
                  are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA
                  genes. When sufficiently similar sequences are not
                  available for comparative approaches the only known
                  remedy is to search directly for structural
                  features. RESULTS: We present here efficient
                  algorithms for computing locally stable RNA
                  structures at genome-wide scales. Both the minimum
                  energy structure and the complete matrix of base
                  pairing probabilities can be computed in O(N x L(2))
                  time and O(N + L(2)) memory in terms of the length N
                  of the genome and the size L of the largest
                  secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice,
                  the 100 Mb of the complete genome of Caenorhabditis
                  elegans can be folded within about half a day on a
                  modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is
                  sufficient example for a survey for
                  miRNAs. AVAILABILITY: The software described in this

                  construction of alpha-carbon representations of a protein 
                  fold. We investigated the dependence of the number of 
                  conformations on pairwise distance restraints for the 
                  proteins crambin, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and 
                  ubiquitin. Knowledge of between one and two contacts per 
                  monomer is shown to be sufficient to restrict the number of 
                  candidate structures to approximately 1,000 conformations. 
                  Pairwise RMS deviations of atomic position comparisons 
                  between pairs of these 1,000 structures revealed that these 
                  conformations can be grouped into about 25 families of 
                  structures. These results suggest a new approach to 
                  assessing alternative protein folds given a very limited 
                  number of distance restraints. Such restraints are available 
                  from several experimental techniques such as NMR, NOESY, 
                  energy transfer fluorescence spectroscopy, and crosslinking 
                  experiments. This work focuses on exhaustive enumeration of 
                  protein structures with emphasis on the possible use of 
                  NOESY-determined distance restraints.}

	for integrated biochemical systems is in order. {T}he purpose of
	this series of papers is to assess the utility of an alternative
	power-law formalism by carrying out a detailed comparative analysis
	of a relatively large, representative system--the tricarboxylic acid
	cycle of {D}ictyostelium discoideum. {T}his system was chosen because
	considerable experimental information already has been synthesized
	into a detailed kinetic model of the intact system. {I}n this first
	paper, we set the stage for subsequent analysis within the framework
	of the power-law formalism: we review the underlying theory, emphasizing
	recent developments, formulate the model in terms that are convenient
	for the analysis to follow, and develop the system representation
	in both the {M}ichaelis-{M}enten and power-law forms. {I}n the second

                  model, which assumes that each position in the DNA site 
                  contributes independently to the overall protein-DNA 
                  interaction, has been the primary means to describe 
                  transcription factor binding site motifs. Recent biological 
                  experiments, however, suggest that there exists 
                  interdependence among positions in the binding sites. In 
                  order to exploit this interdependence to aid motif 
                  discovery, we extend the PWM model to include pairs of 
                  correlated positions and design a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
                  algorithm to sample in the model space. We then combine the 
                  model sampling step with the Gibbs sampling framework for de 
                  novo motif discoveries. RESULTS: Testing on experimentally 
                  validated binding sites, we find that about 25% of the 
                  transcription factor binding motifs show significant 
                  within-site position correlations, and 80% of these motif 
                  models can be improved by considering the correlated 
                  positions. Using both simulated data and real promoter 
                  sequences, we show that the new de novo motif-finding 
                  algorithm can infer the true correlated position pairs 
                  accurately and is more precise in finding putative 
                  transcription factor binding sites than the standard Gibbs 
                  sampling algorithms.}

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts that 
                  exert their function without ever producing proteins. 
                  Noncoding RNA gene sequences do not have strong statistical 
                  signals, unlike protein coding genes. A reliable general 
                  purpose computational genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has 
                  been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence 
                  analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural RNA genes. 
                  The key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions 
                  observed in a pairwise alignment of two homologous 
                  sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a pattern 
                  of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved structural 
                  RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations 
                  consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We 
                  formalize this intuition using three probabilistic 
                  "pair-grammars": a pair stochastic context free grammar 
                  modeling alignments constrained by structural RNA evolution, 
                  a pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments constrained 
                  by coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model 
                  modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent 
                  evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. 
                  from a BLASTN comparison of two related genomes) we classify 
                  the alignment into the coding, RNA, or null class according 
                  to the posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We 
                  have implemented this approach as a program, QRNA, which we 
                  consider to be a prototype structural noncoding RNA 
                  genefinder. Tests suggest that this approach detects 
                  noncoding RNA genes with a fair degree of reliability.}

	{O}ne of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward

	{Y}, and both jointly regulate gene {Z}. {O}n the basis of mathematical
	modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward

                  splicing of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) 
                  pre-mRNA is tightly regulated. A sequence termed ISAR 
                  (intronic splicing activator and repressor) has been 
                  implicated as an important cis regulatory element in both

                  minigenes containing a series of 2-bp mutations in the 18 
                  3'-most nucleotides of ISAR that we refer to as the ISAR 
                  core. Transfection of cells with dual-exon (IIIb and IIIc) 
                  minigenes revealed that mutation of terminal sequences of 
                  the core led to decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased

                  decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased exon IIIc 
                  inclusion, respectively. Nucleotides of the ISAR core 
                  responsible for exon IIIb activation appear to overlap very

                  enzyme-catalyzed, reversible post-translational
                  modification that modulates protein function. It was
                  originally discovered as the pathogenic principle of
                  diphtheria-, cholera-, and other potent bacterial
                  toxins. By analogy, corresponding enyzmes were
                  postulated to exist in animal tissues, and mounting
                  biochemical evidence indicates that such enzymes,
                  indeed, play important regulatory roles in cellular
                  functions. The molecular cloning of the first
                  mammalian mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase from rabbit
                  skeletal muscle, the finding of its homology to a
                  well-studied T-cell marker, RT6, and the molecular
                  cloning of additional gene family members from
                  mammals and birds is providing fresh impetus to
                  research in this field. Intriguingly, these
                  vertebrate enzymes are predicted to be secretory or
                  membrane proteins. They are expressed in lymphatic
                  tissues, muscle, testis, bone marrow, and
                  erythroblasts. Here we review the relationship
                  between this novel family of eucaryotic
                  mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases (mADPRTs),

                  cyclases, and the ADP-ribosylprotein hydrolase (ARH)

                  for comparing two long DNA sequences to identify conserved 
                  segments and for producing informative, high-resolution 
                  displays of the resulting alignments. One display is a 
                  percent identity plot (pip), which shows both the position 
                  in one sequence and the degree of similarity for each 
                  aligning segment between the two sequences in a compact and 
                  easily understandable form. Positions along the horizontal 
                  axis can be labeled with features such as exons of genes and 
                  repetitive elements, and colors can be used to clarify and 
                  enhance the display. The web site also provides a plot of 
                  the locations of those segments in both species (similar to 
                  a dot plot). PipMaker is appropriate for comparing genomic 
                  sequences from any two related species, although the types 
                  of information that can be inferred (e.g., protein-coding 
                  regions and cis-regulatory elements) depend on the level of 
                  conservation and the time and divergence rate since the 
                  separation of the species. Gene regulatory elements are 
                  often detectable as similar, noncoding sequences in species 
                  that diverged as much as 100-300 million years ago, such as 
                  humans and mice, Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, or 
                  Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. PipMaker supports 
                  analysis of unfinished or "working draft" sequences by 
                  permitting one of the two sequences to be in unoriented and 
                  unordered contigs.}

                  proteins are essential for AAV DNA replication and

                  identified a cellular protein interacting with Rep78
                  and Rep68 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST
                  pull-down assays. This protein has recently been
                  described as both a p53 (p53BP3) and a topoisomerase
                  I interacting protein (Topors). It contains an
                  arginine/serine-rich domain, a RING finger domain
                  and five PEST sequences. A minimal sequence
                  sufficient for interaction with Rep was mapped to
                  Topors amino acids 871 to 917. We show that the same
                  region is also involved in the interaction with
                  p53. Rep sequences involved in interaction with
                  Topors were mapped to Rep amino acids 172 to
                  481. Overexpression of Topors stimulated AAV gene
                  expression in the absence of helper virus,
                  suggesting a function of Topors as a transcriptional

                  Fas, yet resist apoptosis induction through its ligation. A 
                  proximal step in apoptotic signaling through Fas is 
                  implicated in this resistance, as these cells undergo normal 
                  levels of apoptosis induction after exposure to tumor 
                  necrosis factor-alpha. We studied the Fas receptors 
                  expressed in human thymocytes to search for mechanisms of 
                  receptor-mediated inhibition of Fas signaling in these 
                  cells. We describe here a unique, membrane-bound form of Fas 
                  receptor that contained a complete extracellular domain of 
                  Fas but that lacked a death domain due to alternative 
                  splicing of exon 7. This Fas decoy receptor (FDR) was shown 
                  to have nearly wild-type ability to bind native human Fas 
                  ligand and was expressed predominantly at the plasma 
                  membrane. Unlike soluble forms of Fas receptor, FDR 
                  dominantly inhibited apoptosis induction by Fas ligand in 
                  transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Titration of FDR 
                  in Fas-expressing cells suggests that FDR may operate 
                  through the formation of mixed receptor complexes. FDR also 
                  dominantly inhibited Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T 
                  cells. In mixing experiments with wild-type Fas, FDR was 
                  capable of inhibiting death signaling at molar ratios less 
                  than 0.5, and this relative level of FDR:wild type message 
                  was observed in at least some thymocytes tested. The data

                  be regulated by expression of a membrane-bound decoy

   abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans vulva is an important paradigm for cell-cell interactions in animal development. The fates of six vulval precursor cells are patterned through the action of the epidermal growth factor receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR-MAPK) inductive signaling pathway, which specifies the 1 degrees fate, and the LIN-12/Notch lateral signaling pathway, which specifies the 2 degrees fate. Here, we provide evidence that the inductive signal is spatially graded and initially activates the EGFR-MAPK pathway in the prospective 2 degrees cells. Subsequently, this effect is counteracted by the expression of multiple new negative regulators of the EGFR-MAPK pathway, under direct transcriptional control of the LIN-12-mediated lateral signal.}

abstract = "{RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNAs. In attempts to identify RNAi triggers that effectively function at lower concentrations, we found that synthetic RNA duplexes 25-30 nucleotides in length can be up to 100-fold more potent than corresponding conventional 21-mer small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Some sites that are refractory to silencing by 21-mer siRNAs can be effectively targeted by 27-mer duplexes, with silencing lasting up to 10 d. Notably, the 27-mers do not induce interferon or activate protein kinase R (PKR). The enhanced potency of the longer duplexes is attributed to the fact that they are substrates of the Dicer endonuclease, directly linking the production of siRNAs to incorporation in the RNA-induced silencing complex. These results provide an alternative strategy for eliciting RNAi-mediated target cleavage using low concentrations of synthetic RNA as substrates for cellular Dicer-mediated cleavage.}",

                  important for constitutive RNA splicing, no helicases have 
                  been implicated in alternative RNA splicing. Here, we show 
                  that the abundant DEAD-box RNA helicase p72, but not its 
                  close relative p68, affects the splicing of alternative 
                  exons containing AC-rich exon enhancer elements. The effect 
                  of p72 was tested by using mini-genes that undergo different 
                  types of alternative splicing. When the concentration of p72 
                  was increased in transient transfections, the inclusion of 
                  enhancer-containing CD44 alternative exons v4 and v5 
                  increased using a mini-gene that contained these exons and 
                  their flanking introns inserted into a beta-globin gene. 
                  Other types of alternative splicing were not impacted by 
                  altering p72 concentrations. Mutation of the p72 helicase 
                  ATP-binding site or deletion of the carboxy-terminal region 
                  of the protein reduced the ability of the transfected 
                  protein to affect CD44 variable exon splicing. Use of in 
                  vitro extracts overexpressing p72 indicated that p72 becomes 
                  associated with complexes containing precursor RNA. 
                  Helicases have been implicated both in altering RNA-RNA 
                  interactions and in remodeling RNA-protein complexes. CD44 
                  exon v4 contains a potential internal secondary structure 
                  element that base pairs the 5' splice site with a region 
                  inside the exon located between enhancer elements. Mutations 
                  that destroyed this complementarity modestly increased 
                  inclusion in the absence of p72 but still responded to 
                  increasing p72 concentration like the wild-type exon, 
                  suggesting that p72 might have effects on protein-RNA 
                  interactions. In agreement with this hypothesis, p72 was not 
                  able to restore the inclusion of an exon mutated for its 
                  major enhancer element. Our results suggest that RNA 
                  helicases may be important alternative splicing regulatory 
                  factors.}

                  selectively bind small molecules. In the past two
                  years, it has become clear that nature has already
                  devised its own aptamers that play important
                  regulatory roles. RNA sensors have been discovered
                  in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
                  that function as molecular switches in response to
                  direct binding of structurally diverse
                  metabolites. These natural RNA aptamers, called
                  'riboswitches', are imbedded in the leader sequences
                  of numerous metabolic genes. Riboswitches are able
                  to repress or activate their cognate genes at both
                  transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we
                  summarize the recent progress in the identification
                  and characterization of riboswitches and discuss
                  their evolution and distribution.}

                  involved in gene regulation and expression is a major 
                  challenge in molecular biology. In this paper we describe a 
                  novel algorithm and the software for searching nucleotide 
                  and protein sequences for complex nucleotide patterns 
                  including potential secondary structure elements, also 
                  allowing for mismatches/mispairings below a user-fixed 
                  threshold, and assessing the statistical significance of 
                  their occurrence through a Markov chain simulation. RESULTS: 
                  The application of the proposed algorithm allowed the 
                  identification of some functional elements, such as the Iron 
                  Responsive Element, the Histone stem-loop structure and the

	Its sequence is species specific. It has already been used extensively

	(where historically, the mitochondrial genes have dominated species
	studies). Despite initial impressions that ITS2 is too variable,
	it has proven to provide useful biological information at higher

	aspects of its transcript secondary structure. The review of all
	eukaryote groups reveals that ITS2 is expandable, but always retains
	in its {RNA} transcript a common core structure of two helices with
	hallmark characteristics important for ribosomal {RNA} processing.
	This aspect of its {RNA} transcript secondary structure can rescue
	difficult alignment problems, making the ITS2 a more powerful tool
	for phylogenetics. Equally important, the recognition of eukaryote-wide

The UGA codon context of the Escherichia coli fdhF mRNA includes an
element called the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) that is
responsible for the UGA-directed incorporation of the amino acid
selenocysteine into a protein. Here, we describe an extended fdhF SECIS
that includes the information for an additional function: the prevention
of UGA readthrough under conditions of selenium deficiency. This
information is contained in a short mRNA region consisting of a single C
residue adjacent to the UGA on its downstream side, and an additional
segment consisting of the six nucleotides immediately upstream from it.
These two regions act independently and additively, and probably through
different mechanisms. The single C residue acts as itself; the upstream
region acts at the level of the two amino acids, arginine and valine, for
which it codes. These two codons at the 5' side of the UGA correspond to
the ribosomal E and P sites. Here, we present a model for the E. coli fdhF
SECIS as a multifunctional RNA structure containing three functional
elements. Depending on the availability of selenium, the SECIS enables one
of two alternatives for the translational machinery: either selenocysteine
incorporation into a polypeptide or termination of the polypeptide chain.}

  abstract =	 {Now that the mouse and human genome sequences are complete, 
                  biologists need systematic approaches to determine the 
                  function of each gene. A powerful way to discover gene 
                  function is to determine the consequence of mutations in 
                  living organisms. Large-scale production of mouse mutations 
                  with the point mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is a key 
                  strategy for analysing the human genome because mouse 
                  mutants will reveal functions unique to mammals, and many 
                  may model human diseases. To examine genes conserved between 
                  human and mouse, we performed a recessive ENU mutagenesis 
                  screen that uses a balancer chromosome, inversion chromosome 
                  11 (refs 4, 5). Initially identified in the fruitfly, 
                  balancer chromosomes are valuable genetic tools that allow 
                  the easy isolation of mutations on selected chromosomes. 
                  Here we show the isolation of 230 new recessive mouse 
                  mutations, 88 of which are on chromosome 11. This genetic 
                  strategy efficiently generates and maps mutations on a 
                  single chromosome, even as mutations throughout the genome 
                  are discovered. The mutations reveal new defects in 
                  haematopoiesis, craniofacial and cardiovascular development, 
                  and fertility.}

   abstract = {The relationship between cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and human neutrophil motility was studied by video microscopy. Neutrophils stimulated by a uniform concentration of an N-formylated peptide chemoattractant (f-Met-Leu-Phe) were tracked during chemokinetic migration on albumin, fibronectin, and vitronectin. [Ca2+]i buffering with quin2 resulted in significant decreases in mean speed on albumin. To further characterize the relationship between [Ca2+]i changes and motility we carried out a cross-correlation analysis of [Ca2+]i with several motility parameters. Cross-correlations between [Ca2+]i and each cell's speed, angle changes, turn strength, and persistent forward motion revealed (i) a positive correlation between [Ca2+]i and cell speed (p \&lt; 0.05), (ii) no significant correlation between turns and calcium spikes, and (iii) the occurrence of turns during periods of low speed. Significant negative correlations between [Ca2+]i and angle change were noted on the high adhesion substrates vitronectin and fibronectin but not on the low adhesion substrate albumin. These data imply that there is a general temporal relationship between [Ca2+]i, speed, and persistent motion. However, the correlations are not sufficiently strong to imply that changes in [Ca2+]i are required proximal signals for velocity changes.}

                  proteins. Such a catalogue cannot be constructed by 
                  computational annotation alone; it requires experimental 
                  validation on a genome scale. Using 'exon' and 'tiling' 
                  arrays fabricated by ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesis, we 
                  devised an experimental approach to validate and refine 
                  computational gene predictions and define full-length 
                  transcripts on the basis of co-regulated expression of their

                  identification of the tissue- and disease-specific

                  technique to chromosome 22q under 69 experimental condition 
                  pairs, and to the entire human genome under two experimental

                  consistent and reliable genome annotation, more efficient, 
                  full-length complementary DNA cloning strategies and

a high-affinity binding site for Rev of the HIV-1 Rev responsive element
(RRE), two derivatives of RBE3 (RBE3AA and RBE3-A), and the complex of RBE3
with peptides derived from the RNA binding domain of HIV-1 Rev, are
presented. The high-affinity binding site of the RRE consists of an
asymmetric internal loop and surrounding Watson-Crick base pairs. In the
wild-type RRE, one of the stems is closed by a loop; this is replaced in
REB3 by the stable UUCG tetraloop. NOE data suggest that the internal loop
of the free RNA contains structural features that have been predicted on the
basis of in vitro selection experiments [Bartel, D.P., et al. (1991) Cell
67, 529-536]. The structural features include a Gsyn.Ganti base pair, a
Ganti.Aanti base pair, and a looped out U. When the Rev peptide is bound to
the RNA, the base pairs in the internal loop appear to be stabilized,
although the RNA chemical shifts indicate that the RNA conformation
undergoes some changes when bound by Rev peptide.}

  abstract =	 {Because deleterious alleles arising from mutation are 
                  filtered by natural selection, mutations that create such 
                  alleles will be underrepresented in the set of common 
                  genetic variation existing in a population at any given 
                  time. Here, we describe an approach based on this idea 
                  called VERIFY (variant elimination reinforces 
                  functionality), which can be used to assess the extent of 
                  natural selection acting on an oligonucleotide motif or set 
                  of motifs predicted to have biological activity. As an 
                  application of this approach, we analyzed a set of 238 
                  hexanucleotides previously predicted to have exonic splicing 
                  enhancer (ESE) activity in human exons using the relative 
                  enhancer and silencer classification by unanimous enrichment 
                  (RESCUE)-ESE method. Aligning the single nucleotide 
                  polymorphisms (SNPs) from the public human SNP database to 
                  the chimpanzee genome allowed inference of the direction of 
                  the mutations that created present-day SNPs. Analyzing the 
                  set of SNPs that overlap RESCUE-ESE hexamers, we conclude 
                  that nearly one-fifth of the mutations that disrupt 
                  predicted ESEs have been eliminated by natural selection 
                  (odds ratio = 0.82 +/- 0.05). This selection is strongest 
                  for the predicted ESEs that are located near splice sites. 
                  Our results demonstrate a novel approach for quantifying the 
                  extent of natural selection acting on candidate functional 
                  motifs and also suggest certain features of mutations/SNPs, 
                  such as proximity to the splice site and disruption or 
                  alteration of predicted ESEs, that should be useful in 
                  identifying variants that might cause a biological 
                  phenotype.}

                  secondary structures in the mRNAs of selenoproteins. These 
                  elements differ in sequence, structure, and location in the 
                  mRNA, that is, coding versus 3' untranslated region, in 
                  prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Analyses of eukaryotic 
                  selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements via 
                  computer folding programs, mutagenesis studies, and chemical 
                  and enzymatic probing has led to the derivation of a 
                  predicted consensus structural model for these elements. 
                  This model consists of a stem-loop or hairpin, with 
                  conserved nucleotides in the loop and in a non-Watson-Crick 
                  motif at the base of the stem. However, the sequences of a 
                  number of SECIS elements predict that they would diverge 
                  from the consensus structure in the loop region. Using 
                  site-directed mutagenesis to introduce mutations predicted 
                  to either disrupt or restore structure, or to manipulate 
                  loop size or stem length, we show that eukaryotic SECIS 
                  elements fall into two distinct classes, termed forms 1 and 
                  2. Form 2 elements have additional secondary structures not 
                  present in form 1 elements. By either insertion or deletion 
                  of the sequences and structures distinguishing the two 
                  classes of elements while maintaining appropriate loop size, 
                  conversion of a form 1 element to a functional form 2-like 
                  element and of a form 2 to a functional form 1-like element 
                  was achieved. These results suggest commonality of function 
                  of the two classes. The information obtained regarding the 
                  existence of two classes of SECIS elements and the 
                  tolerances for manipulations of stem length and loop size 
                  should facilitate designing RNA molecules for obtaining 
                  high-resolution structural information about these elements.}

                  secondary structural motif in the 3' untranslated region of 
                  the selenoprotein mRNA. This selenocysteine insertion 
                  sequence (SECIS) element is predicted to form a hairpin and 
                  contains three regions of sequence invariance that are 
                  thought to interact with a specific protein or proteins. 
                  Specificity of RNA-binding protein recognition of cognate 
                  RNAs is usually characterized by the ability of the protein 
                  to recognize and distinguish between a consensus binding 
                  site and sequences containing mutations to highly conserved 
                  positions in the consensus sequence. Using a functional 
                  assay for the ability of wild-type and mutant SECIS elements 
                  to direct cotranslational selenocysteine incorporation, we 
                  have investigated the relative contributions of individual

                  the novel finding that, for this consensus RNA motif, 
                  mutations at the invariant nucleotides are tolerated to 
                  different degrees in different elements, depending on the 
                  identity of a single nonconserved nucleotide. Further, we 
                  demonstrate that the sequences adjacent to the minimal 
                  element, although not required for function, can affect 
                  function through their propensity to base pair. These 
                  findings shed light on the specific structure these 
                  conserved sequences may form within the element. This 
                  information is crucial to the design of strategies for the 
                  identification of SECIS-binding proteins, and hence the 
                  elucidation of the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation

                  B-DNA of the twist angles, base pair roll, sideways shift, 
                  and propeller suppression in 56 promoters at the three 
                  sites. I also appended to these the twist angle computations 
                  on additional 77 promoters from the recently published 
                  compilation of promoter sequences. For the latter, 
                  additional nucleotides from the spacer regions were added. 
                  The results display similarities at the -10 site. Equally 
                  strong similarities were obtained for the -35 and the -16 
                  contact regions. The existence of structural differences for 
                  some sites is likely to account for the different degrees of 
                  efficiency of the polymerase recognition and transcriptional 
                  regulation.}

                  biological problems is to find a Viterbi (maximal weight) 
                  path through the HMM graph. The Viterbi algorithm reduces 
                  the problem of finding the most likely hidden state sequence 
                  that explains given observations, to a dynamic programming 
                  problem for corresponding directed acyclic graphs. For 
                  example, in the gene finding application, the HMM is used to 
                  find the most likely underlying gene structure given a DNA 
                  sequence. In this note we discuss the applications of 
                  sampling methods for HMMs. The standard sampling algorithm 
                  for HMMs is a variant of the common forward-backward and 
                  backtrack algorithms, and has already been applied in the 
                  context of Gibbs sampling methods. Nevetheless, the practice 
                  of sampling state paths from HMMs does not seem to have been 
                  widely adopted, and important applications have been 
                  overlooked. We show how sampling can be used for finding 
                  alternative splicings for genes, including alternative 
                  splicings that are conserved between genes from related 
                  organisms. We also show how sampling from the posterior 
                  distribution is a natural way to compute probabilities for 
                  predicted exons and gene structures being correct under the 
                  assumed model. Finally, we describe a new memory efficient 
                  sampling algorithm for certain classes of HMMs which 
                  provides a practical sampling alternative to the Hirschberg 
                  algorithm for optimal alignment. The ideas presented have 
                  applications not only to gene finding and HMMs but more 
                  generally to stochastic context free grammars and RNA 
                  structure prediction. Key words: suboptimal parses,

                  cells, leading to epithelial hyperstratification of
                  the structures. mRNAs of transcription factors
                  essential for forebrain development such as Emx1/2

                  Islet1+Lim1/2- motoneurons appeared by the addition
                  of Noggin. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth
                  factor (bFGF) promoted enlargement of central lumen
                  and elongation of the structures. mRNAs of caudal
                  markers, Gbx2, Cdx2 and Hoxb4/9 were expressed and
                  Lim1/2+ spinal motoneurons appeared by the addition

                  mild enlargement of central lumen of the

                  induced Slug+ neural crest-like cells surrounding
                  the tube-like structures. mRNAs of Snail and dHand,
                  other markers for neural crest cells, were also
                  expressed by the addition of BMP-4. These results
                  suggest that Noggin lead the neural-tube like
                  structures to forebrain fate, whereas bFGF was

                  rarely during translation, yet some genes have evolved
                  sequences that efficiently induce frameshifting. These
                  sequences, termed programmed frameshift sites,
                  manipulate the translational apparatus to promote
                  non-canonical decoding. Frameshifts are
                  mechanistically diverse. Most cause a -1 shift of
                  frames; the first such site was discovered in a
                  metazoan retrovirus, but they are now known to be
                  dispersed quite widely among evolutionarily diverse
                  species. +1 frameshift sites are much less common, but
                  again dispersed widely. The rarest form are the
                  translational hop sites which program the ribosome to
                  bypass a region of several dozen nucleotides. Each of
                  these types of events are stimulated by distinct
                  mechanisms. All of the events share a common
                  phenomenology in which the programmed frameshift site
                  causes the ribosome to pause during elongation so that
                  the kinetically unfavorable alternative decoding event
                  can occur. During this pause most frameshifts occur
                  because one or more ribosome-bound tRNAs slip between
                  cognate or near-cognate codons. However, even this
                  generalization is not entirely consistent, since some
                  frameshifts occur without slippage. Because of their
                  similarity to rarer translational errors, programmed
                  frameshift sites provide a tool with which to probe
                  the mechanism of frame maintenance.},

  abstract = {The formation of a duplex between two nucleic acid strands is restricted
	if one of the strands forms an intra- or intermolecular secondary
	structure. The formation of the new duplex requires the dissociation
	and replacement of the initial structure. To understand the mechanism
	of this type of kinetics we studied the replacement of a labeled
	DNA oligonucleotide probe bound to a complementary DNA target with
	an unlabeled probe of the same sequence. The replacement kinetics
	were measured using a gel-shift assay for 12, 14 and 16-nucleotide
	probes as a function of temperature and concentration of the unlabeled
	probe. The results demonstrate that the overall replacement rate
	is a combination of two kinetic pathways: dissociative and sequential
	displacement. The dissociative pathway occurs by the spontaneous
	dissociation of the initial duplex followed by association of the
	target and unlabeled probe. The sequential displacement pathway requires
	only the partial melting of the initial duplex to allow for the formation
	of a branched nucleation complex with the unlabeled probe, followed
	by the complete displacement of the labeled probe by migration of
	the branch point. The contribution from the dissociative pathway
	is predominant at temperatures close to the melting point of the
	labeled probe, whereas the contribution from the displacement pathway

                  controls the expression of numerous genes in response to 
                  developmental and extracellular signals. Poly(A) tail 
                  regulation requires cooperative binding of two human U1A 
                  proteins to an RNA regulatory region called the 
                  polyadenylation inhibition element (PIE). When bound to PIE 
                  RNA, U1A proteins also bind to the enzyme responsible for 
                  formation of the mature 3'-end of most eukaryotic mRNAs, 
                  poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The NMR structure of the 38 kDa 
                  complex formed between two U1A molecules and PIE RNA shows 
                  that binding cooperativity depends on helix C located at the 
                  end of the RNA-binding domain and just adjacent to the 
                  PAP-interacting domain of U1A. Since helix C undergoes a 
                  conformational change upon RNA binding, the structure shows 
                  that binding cooperativity and interactions with PAP occur 
                  only when U1A is bound to its cognate RNA. This mechanism 
                  ensures that the activity of PAP enzyme, which is essential 
                  to the cell, is only down regulated when U1A is bound to the 
                  U1A mRNA.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Automatic extraction of motifs that occur 
                  frequently on a set of unaligned DNA sequences is useful for 
                  predicting the binding sites of unknown transcription 
                  factors. Several programs for this purpose have been 
                  released. However, in our opinion, they are not practical 
                  enough to be applied to a large number of upstream 
                  sequences. RESULTS: We propose a new program called YEBIS 
                  (Yet another Environment for the analysis of BIopolymer 
                  Sequences) which is capable of extracting a set of motifs, 
                  without any a priori knowledge, from a number of 
                  functionally related DNA sequences. Using the hidden Markov 
                  model, these motifs are represented in a more general form 
                  than other conventional methods, such as the weight matrix 
                  method. When applied to several sets of benchmark data, it 
                  was found that YEBIS had comparable capability to the 
                  existing methods, but was much faster. Moreover, it could 
                  extract all known motifs from the LTR sequences (long 
                  terminal repeat sequences) in a single run. Finally, it 
                  could be successfully applied to approximately 400 human 
                  promoter sequences and some of the extracted motifs turned 
                  out to be known cis-elements. Therefore, YEBIS could be a 
                  practical tool for exploring the upstream sequences of 
                  genomic ORFs, some of which are regulated in a similar 
                  fashion. AVAILABILITY: YEBIS will be distributed to academic 
                  users free of charge. All requests should be sent to the

                  all suboptimal secondary structures between the
                  minimum free energy and an arbitrary upper
                  limit. The algorithm is particularly fast in the
                  vicinity of the minimum free energy. This enables
                  the efficient approximation of statistical
                  quantities, such as the partition function or
                  measures for structural diversity. The density of
                  states at low energies and its associated structures
                  are crucial in assessing from a thermodynamic point
                  of view how well-defined the ground state is. We
                  demonstrate this by exploring the role of base
                  modification in tRNA secondary structures, both at
                  the level of individual sequences from Escherichia
                  coli and by comparing artificially generated
                  ensembles of modified and unmodified sequences with
                  the same tRNA structure. The two major conclusions
                  are that (1) base modification considerably sharpens
                  the definition of the ground state structure by
                  constraining energetically adjacent structures to be
                  similar to the ground state, and (2) sequences whose
                  ground state structure is thermodynamically well
                  defined show a significant tendency to buffer single
                  point mutations. This can have evolutionary

                  palindromic. Nevertheless, the protein molecule obtained as 
                  a result of reading the sequence backwards, i.e. a 
                  retro-protein, obviously has the same amino acid composition 
                  and the same hydrophobicity profile as the native sequence. 
                  The important questions which arise in the context of 
                  retro-proteins are: does a retro-protein fold to a well 
                  defined native-like structure as natural proteins do and, if 
                  the answer is positive, does a retro-protein fold to a 
                  structure similar to the native conformation of the original 
                  protein? In this work, the fold of retro-protein A, 
                  originated from the retro-sequence of the B domain of 
                  Staphylococcal protein A, was studied. As a result of 
                  lattice model simulations, it is conjectured that the 
                  retro-protein A also forms a three-helix bundle structure in 
                  solution. It is also predicted that the topology of the 
                  retro-protein A three-helix bundle is that of the native 
                  protein A, rather than that corresponding to the mirror 
                  image of native protein A. Secondary structure elements in 
                  the retro-protein do not exactly match their counterparts in 
                  the original protein structure; however, the amino acid side 
                  chain contract pattern of the hydrophobic core is partly 
                  conserved.}

Even when the involved physicochemical signals are unknown, the cellular system can be treated phenomenologically like an automatic controller having a closed-loop feedback system. The model is verified by means of galvanotaxis and chemotaxis data of human granulocytes. The galvanotaxis and chemotaxis coefficient quantifying the cellular sensibility can be predicted from the coefficient which characterizes the deterministic part of the signal transduction/response system of the cell divided by the coefficient which characterizes the noise strength in the cellular signal transduction/response system. The model is not restricted to directed movement of granulocytes. It is very general and can be applied to any cell type for directed phenomena like chemotaxis, galvanotaxis, phototaxis, magnetotaxis, directed growth, etc. The virus-disturbed directed migration of granulocytes is discussed and it is shown that the virus alters the deterministic part of the cellular controller.}

	containing a set of immobilized oligonucleotides is being developed.
	A theoretical analysis is presented of the kinetics of {DNA} hybridization
	with deoxynucleotide molecules chemically tethered in a polyacrylamide
	gel layer. The analysis has shown that long-term evolution of the
	spatial distribution and of the amount of {DNA} bound in a hybridization
	cell is governed by "retarded diffusion," i.e., diffusion of the
	DNA interrupted by repeated association and dissociation with immobile
	oligonucleotide molecules. Retarded diffusion determines the characteristic
	time of establishing a final equilibrium state in a cell, i.e., the
	state with the maximum quantity and a uniform distribution of bound
	DNA. In the case of cells with the most stable, perfect duplexes,
	the characteristic time of retarded diffusion (which is proportional
	to the equilibrium binding constant and to the concentration of binding
	sites) can be longer than the duration of the real hybridization
	procedure. This conclusion is indirectly confirmed by the observation
	of nonuniform fluorescence of labeled {DNA} in perfect-match hybridization
	cells (brighter at the edges). For optimal discrimination of perfect
	duplexes from duplexes with mismatches the hybridization process
	should be brought to equilibrium under low-temperature nonsaturation
	conditions for all cells. The kinetic differences between perfect
	and nonperfect duplexes in the gel allow further improvement in the
	discrimination through additional washing at low temperature after
	hybridization.},

  abstract =	 {Transcription factor binding sites are short fragments in 
                  the upstream regions of genes, to which transcription 
                  factors bind to regulate the transcription of genes into 
                  mRNA. Computational identification of transcription factor 
                  binding sites remains an unsolved challenging problem though 
                  a great amount of effort has been put into the study of this 
                  problem. We have recently developed a novel technique for 
                  identification of binding sites from a set of upstream 
                  regions of genes, that could possibly be transcriptionally 
                  co-regulated and hence might share similar transcription 
                  factor binding sites. By utilizing two key features of such 
                  binding sites (i.e. their high sequence similarities and 
                  their relatively high frequencies compared to other sequence 
                  fragments), we have formulated this problem as a cluster 
                  identification problem. That is to identify and extract data 
                  clusters from a noisy background. While the classical data 
                  clustering problem (partitioning a data set into clusters 
                  sharing common or similar features) has been extensively 
                  studied, there is no general algorithm for solving the 
                  problem of identifying data clusters from a noisy 
                  background. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for 
                  solving such a problem. We have proved that a cluster 
                  identification problem, under our definition, can be 
                  rigorously and efficiently solved through searching for 
                  substrings with special properties in a linear sequence. We 
                  have also developed a method for assessing the statistical 
                  significance of each identified cluster, which can be used 
                  to rule out accidental data clusters. We have implemented 
                  the cluster identification algorithm and the statistical 
                  significance analysis method as a computer software CUBIC. 
                  Extensive testing on CUBIC has been carried out. We present 
                  here a few applications of CUBIC on challenging cases of 
                  binding site identification.}

MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in sets of protein or DNA sequences.
This paper describes several extensions to MEME which increase its ability
to find motifs in a totally unsupervised fashion, but which also allow it
to benefit when prior knowledge is available. When no background knowledge
is asserted. MEME obtains increased robustness from a method for
determining motif widths automatically, and from probabilistic models that
allow motifs to be absent in some input sequences. On the other hand, MEME
can exploit prior knowledge about a motif being present in all input
sequences, about the length of a motif and whether it is a palindrome, and
(using Dirichlet mixtures) about expected patterns in individual motif
positions. Extensive experiments are reported which support the claim that
MEME benefits from, but does not require, background knowledge. The
experiments use seven previously studied DNA and protein sequence families
and 75 of the protein families documented in the Prosite database of sites
and patterns, Release 11.1.}

  abstract =	 {Motivation: The identification of regulatory control
                  regions within genomes is a major challenge. Studies
                  have demonstrated that regulating regions can be
                  described as locally dense clusters or modules of
                  cis-acting transcription factor binding sites
                  (TFBS). For well-described biological contexts, it
                  is possible to train predictive algorithms to
                  discern novel modules in genome sequences. However,
                  utility of module detection methods has been
                  severely limited by insufficient training data. For
                  only a few tissues can one obtain sufficient numbers
                  of literature-derived regulatory modules. Results:
                  We present a novel method, MSCAN, that circumvents
                  the training data problem by measuring the
                  statistical significance of any non-overlapping
                  combination of TFBS in a window. Given a set of
                  transcription factor binding profiles, a
                  significance threshold, and a genomic sequence,
                  MSCAN returns putative regulatory regions. We assess
                  performance on two curated collections of regulatory
                  regions; one each for tissue-specific expression in
                  liver and skeletal muscle cells. The efficiency of
                  MSCAN allows for predictive screens of entire
                  genomes. Availability:

  abstract =	 {We have examined the alternative splicing of the Drosophila 
                  melanogaster prospero twintron, which contains splice sites 
                  for both the U2- and U12-type spliceosome and generates two 
                  forms of mRNA, pros-L (U2-type product) and pros-S (U12-type 
                  product). We find that twintron splicing is developmentally 
                  regulated: pros-L is abundant in early embryogenesis while 
                  pros-S displays the opposite pattern. We have established a 
                  Kc cell in vitro splicing system that accurately splices a 
                  minimal pros substrate containing the twintron and have 
                  examined the sequence requirements for pros twintron 
                  splicing. Systematic deletion and mutation analysis of 
                  intron sequences established that twintron splicing requires 
                  a 46-nucleotide purine-rich element located 32 nucleotides 
                  downstream of the U2-type 5' splice site. While this element 
                  regulates both splicing pathways, its alteration showed the 
                  severest effects on the U2-type splicing pathway. Addition 
                  of an RNA competitor containing the wild-type purine-rich 
                  element to the Kc extract abolished U2-type splicing and 
                  slightly repressed U12-type splicing, suggesting that a 
                  trans-acting factor(s) binds the enhancer element to 
                  stimulate twintron splicing. Thus, we have identified an 
                  intron region critical for prospero twintron splicing as a 
                  first step towards elucidating the molecular mechanism of 
                  splicing regulation involving competition between the two 
                  kinds of spliceosomes.}

	a large number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets
	are known. In contrast to plant miRNAs, which usually bind nearly
	perfectly to their targets, animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with
	a few nucleotides being unbound, thus producing more complex secondary
	structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we present a program,
	RNA-hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of miRNAs
	in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the energetically
	most favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA.
	Intramolecular hybridizations, that is, base pairings between target
	nucleotides or between miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large
	targets, the time complexity of the algorithm is linear in the target
	length, allowing many long targets to be searched in a short time.
	Statistical significance of predicted targets is assessed with an
	extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free energies,
	a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation
	of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies
	of multiple organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of

                  protein chains. One of us (E.I.S.) selected 10
                  compact conformations of 48-mer chains on the
                  three-dimensional cubic lattice and used their
                  inverse folding algorithm to design HP (H,
                  hydrophobic; P, polar) sequences that should fold to
                  those "target" structures. The sequences, but not
                  the structures, were sent to the UCSF group (K.Y.,
                  K.M.F., P.D.T., H.S.C., and K.A.D.), who used two
                  methods to attempt to find the globally optimal
                  conformations: "hydrophobic zippers" and a
                  constraint-based hydrophobic core construction
                  (CHCC) method. The CHCC method found global minima
                  in all cases, and the hydrophobic zippers method
                  found global minima in some cases, in minutes to
                  hours on workstations. In 9 out of 10 sequences, the
                  CHCC method found lower energy conformations than
                  the 48-mers were designed to fold to. Thus the
                  search strategies succeed for the HP model but the
                  design strategy does not. For every sequence the
                  global energy minimum was found to have multiple
                  degeneracy with 10(3) to 10(6) conformations. We
                  discuss the implications of these results for (i)
                  searching conformational spaces of simple models of
                  proteins and (ii) how these simple models relate to

abstract = {The function of a non-protein-coding RNA is often determined by its structure. Since experimental determination of RNA structure is time-consuming and expensive, its computational prediction is of great interest, and efficient solutions based on thermodynamic parameters are known. Frequently, however, the predicted minimum free energy structures are not the native ones, leading to the necessity of generating suboptimal solutions. While this can be accomplished by a number of programs, the user is often confronted with large outputs of similar structures, although he or she is interested in structures with more fundamental differences, or, in other words, with different abstract shapes. Here, we formalize the concept of abstract shapes and introduce their efficient computation. Each shape of an RNA molecule comprises a class of similar structures and has a representative structure of minimal free energy within the class. Shape analysis is implemented in the program RNAshapes. We applied RNAshapes to the prediction of optimal and suboptimal abstract shapes of several RNAs. For a given energy range, the number of shapes is considerably smaller than the number of structures, and in all cases, the native structures were among the top shape representatives. This demonstrates that the researcher can quickly focus on the structures of interest, without processing up to thousands of near-optimal solutions. We complement this study with a large-scale analysis of the growth behaviour of structure and shape spaces. RNAshapes is available for download and as an online version on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server.},

                  protein interaction data. Our approach is based on
                  the assumption that many pathways exhibit two
                  properties: their genes exhibit a similar gene
                  expression profile, and the protein products of the
                  genes often interact. Our approach is based on a
                  unified probabilistic model, which is learned from
                  the data using the EM algorithm. We present results
                  on two Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data
                  sets, combined with a binary protein interaction
                  data set. Our results show that our approach is much
                  more successful than other approaches at discovering
                  both coherent functional groups and entire protein
                  complexes. Contact: eran

  abstract =	 {We define a \&quot;threaded blockset,\&quot; which
                  is a novel generalization of the classic notion of a
                  multiple alignment. A new computer program called
                  TBA (for \&quot;threaded blockset aligner\&quot;)
                  builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that
                  all matching segments occur in the same order and
                  orientation in the given sequences; inversions and
                  duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to
                  be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means
                  all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian
                  genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any
                  genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that
                  different projections present consistent predictions
                  of which genomic positions are orthologous. This
                  capability is illustrated using a new visualization
                  tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate
                  Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish
                  perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment
                  quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary
                  change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is
                  more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the
                  dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a
                  stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used
                  to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced
                  genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce
                  the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa
                  Cruz Genome Browser.}

                  structure assignments, and additional distance
                  constraints. A cost function taking such constraints
                  into account was used to obtain protein structures
                  using a simple minimization algorithm. For small
                  proteins, the approximate structure could be
                  obtained using one additional distance constraint
                  for each amino acid in the protein. We also studied
                  the effect of using predicted secondary structure
                  and surface assignments. The constraints used in
                  this approach typically may be obtained from
                  low-resolution experimental data. When using a cost
                  function based on distances, half of the resulting

  abstract =	 {The Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion 
                  molecule (Dscam) gene encodes an axon guidance receptor that 
                  can express 38,016 different mRNAs by virtue of alternative 
                  splicing. The Dscam gene contains 95 alternative exons that 
                  are organized into four clusters of 12, 48, 33, and 2 exons 
                  each. Although numerous Dscam mRNA isoforms can be 
                  synthesized, it remains to be determined whether different 
                  Dscam isoforms are synthesized at different times in 
                  development or in different tissues. We have investigated 
                  the alternative splicing of the Dscam exon 4 cluster, which 
                  contains 12 mutually exclusive alternative exons, and found 
                  that Dscam exon 4 alternative splicing is developmentally 
                  regulated. The most highly regulated exon, 4.2, is 
                  infrequently used in early embryos but is the predominant 
                  exon 4 variant used in adults. Moreover, the developmental 
                  regulation of exon 4.2 alternative splicing is conserved in 
                  D. yakuba. In addition, different adult tissues express 
                  distinct collections of Dscam mRNA isoforms. Given the role 
                  of Dscam in neural development, these results suggest that 
                  the regulation of alternative splicing plays an important 
                  role in determining the specificity of neuronal wiring. In 
                  addition, this work provides a framework to determine the 
                  mechanisms by which complex alternative splicing events are 
                  regulated.}

abstract = "{We previously described the existence of abundant, processed, polyadenylated murine Hoxa 11 antisense transcripts. Of particular interest, in the developing limbs the antisense transcripts were observed to be present in a pattern complementary to that of the sense transcripts, suggesting a possible regulatory function (Hsieh-Li et al. 1995). We have analyzed the human HOXA 11 genomic locus, showing strong evolutionary conservation of regions potentially encoding antisense transcripts. Human HOXA 11 fetal kidney antisense cDNAs were identified and sequenced, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of Hoxa 11 antisense transcription. As for the mouse, the human antisense RNAs were polyadenylated and showed several alternative processing patterns, but shared the sequences of a common 3' exon. The evolutionary conservation of the opposite strand transcripts strongly suggests function. A significantly long open reading frame was observed, but mouse-human comparisons argued against true coding function. Murine kidney Hoxa 11 antisense transcription and processing was also examined, revealing tissue-specific differences between limb and kidney. A novel procedure, designated Race in Circles, was devised and used to define mouse limb antisense transcription start sites. Furthermore, comparisons of human, mouse, and chicken sense transcript Hoxa 11 homeobox nucleotide sequences and their respective encoded homeodomains indicate a very strong selective pressure in vertebrates against mutations that result in coding changes. Given the significant differences in amino acid sequences of the homeodomains of different Hox genes, this observation argues for individual homeodomain functional specificity.}",

  abstract = {The RNA folding map, understood as the relationship
  between sequences and s econdary structures or shapes, exhibits
  robust statistical properties summarized by three notions: (1) the
  notion of a typical shape (that among all sequences of fixed length
  certain shapes are realized much more frequently than others), (2)
  the notion of shape space covering (that all typical shapes are
  realized in a small neighborho od of any random sequence), and (3)
  the notion of a neutral network (that sequences folding into the
  same typical shape form networks that percolate through sequence sp
  ace).

  The concept of a neutral network is particularly
  illuminating. Neutral networks loos en the requirements on the
  mutation rate for selection to remain effective. What nee ds to be
  preserved in a population is not a particular sequence, but rather a
  shape.  This mandates a reformulation of the original (genotypic)
  error threshold in terms of a phenotypic error threshold confirming
  the intuition that more errors can be tol erated at higher degrees
  of neutrality.

  With regard to adaptation, neutrality has two seemingly
  contradictory effects: It ac ts as a buffer against mutations
  ensuring that a phenotype is preserved. Yet it is d eeply enabling,
  because it permits evolutionary change to occur by allowing the sequ
  ence context to vary silently until a single point mutation can
  become phenotypicall y consequential. Neutrality also influences
  predictability of adaptive trajectories in seemingly contradictory
  ways. On the one hand it increases the uncertainty of the ir
  genotypic trace. At the same time neutrality structures the access
  from one shape to another, thereby inducing a topology among RNA
  shapes which permits a distinctio n between continuous and
  discontinuous shape transformations. To the extent that ada ptive
  trajectories must undergo such transformations, their phenotypic
  trace becomes more predictable.}

	such as soils. In order to get access to this microbial "black-box,"
	the development of powerful tools such as microarrays are necessary.
	However, the reliability of this approach relies on probe efficiency,
	in particular sensitivity, specificity and explorative power, in
	order to obtain an image of the microbial communities that is close
	to reality. RESULTS: We propose a new probe design algorithm that
	is able to select microarray probes targeting SSU r{RNA} at any phylogenetic
	level. This original approach, implemented in a program called "PhylArray",
	designs a combination of degenerate and non-degenerate probes for
	each target taxon. Comparative experimental evaluations indicate
	that probes designed with PhylArray yield a higher sensitivity and
	specificity than those designed by conventional approaches. Applying
	the combined PhyArray/GoArrays strategy helps to optimize the hybridization
	performance of short probes. Finally, hybridizations with environmental
	targets have shown that the use of the PhylArray strategy can draw
	attention to even previously unknown bacteria. AVAILABILITY: http://fc.isima.fr/~rimour/phylarray/

  abstract =	 {Protein domains represent the basic evolutionary units that 
                  form proteins. Domain duplication and shuffling by 
                  recombination are probably the most important forces driving 
                  protein evolution and hence the complexity of the proteome. 
                  While the duplication of whole genes as well as 
                  domain-encoding exons increases the abundance of domains in 
                  the proteome, domain shuffling increases versatility, i.e. 
                  the number of distinct contexts in which a domain can occur. 
                  Here, we describe a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of 
                  the relationship between these two processes. We observe a 
                  strong and robust correlation between domain versatility and 
                  abundance: domains that occur more often also have many 
                  different combination partners. This supports the view that 
                  domain recombination occurs in a random way. However, we do 
                  not observe all the different combinations that are expected 
                  from a simple random recombination scenario, and this is due 
                  to frequent duplication of specific domain combinations. 
                  When we simulate the evolution of the protein repertoire 
                  considering stochastic recombination of domains followed by 
                  extensive duplication of the combinations, we approximate 
                  the observed data well. Our analyses are consistent with a 
                  stochastic process that governs domain recombination and 
                  thus protein divergence with respect to domains within a 
                  polypeptide chain. At the same time, they support a scenario 
                  in which domain combinations are formed only once during the 
                  evolution of the protein repertoire, and are then duplicated 
                  to various extents. The extent of duplication of different 
                  combinations varies widely and, in nature, will depend on 
                  selection for the domain combination based on its function. 
                  Some of the pair-wise domain combinations that are highly 
                  duplicated also recur frequently with other partner domains, 
                  and thus represent evolutionary units larger than single 
                  protein domains, which we term "supra-domains".}

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {173},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have a multitude of roles in
	the cell, many of which remain to be discovered. However, it is difficult
	to detect novel ncRNAs in biochemical screens. To advance biological
	knowledge, computational methods that can accurately detect ncRNAs
	in sequenced genomes are therefore desirable. The increasing number
	of genomic sequences provides a rich dataset for computational comparative
	sequence analysis and detection of novel ncRNAs. RESULTS: Here, Dynalign,
	a program for predicting secondary structures common to two RNA sequences
	on the basis of minimizing folding free energy change, is utilized
	as a computational ncRNA detection tool. The Dynalign-computed optimal
	total free energy change, which scores the structural alignment and
	the free energy change of folding into a common structure for two
	RNA sequences, is shown to be an effective measure for distinguishing
	ncRNA from randomized sequences. To make the classification as a
	ncRNA, the total free energy change of an input sequence pair can
	either be compared with the total free energy changes of a set of
	control sequence pairs, or be used in combination with sequence length
	and nucleotide frequencies as input to a classification support vector
	machine. The latter method is much faster, but slightly less sensitive
	at a given specificity. Additionally, the classification support
	vector machine method is shown to be sensitive and specific on genomic
	ncRNA screens of two different Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi
	genome alignments, in which many ncRNAs are known. The Dynalign computational
	experiments are also compared with two other ncRNA detection programs,
	RNAz and QRNA. CONCLUSION: The Dynalign-based support vector machine
	method is more sensitive for known ncRNAs in the test genomic screens
	than RNAz and QRNA. Additionally, both Dynalign-based methods are
	more sensitive than RNAz and QRNA at low sequence pair identities.
	Dynalign can be used as a comparable or more accurate tool than RNAz
	or QRNA in genomic screens, especially for low-identity regions.
	Dynalign provides a method for discovering ncRNAs in sequenced genomes
	that other methods may not identify. Significant improvements in
	Dynalign runtime have also been achieved.},

positions 121 and 236 in Escherichia coli RNase P RNA (M1 RNA) has been
demonstrated in eubacterial RNase P RNAs. To investigate whether the
nucleotides at these positions interact in M1 RNA we introduced base
substitutions at either or at both of these positions. Single base
substitutions at 121 or at 236 resulted in M1 RNA molecules which did not
complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype associated with rnpA49 in
vivo whereas wild-type M1 RNA or the double mutant M1 RNA, with restored
base-pairing between 121 and 236, did. In addition, wild-type and the double
mutant M1 RNA were efficiently cleaved by Pb++ between positions 122 and 123
whereas the rate of this cleavage was significantly reduced for the singly
mutated M1 RNA variants. From these data we conclude that the nucleotides at
positions 121 and 236 in M1 RNA establish a novel long-range tertiary
interaction in M1 RNA. Our results also demonstrated that this interaction
is not absolutely required for cleavage in vitro, however, a disruption
resulted in a reduction in cleavage efficiency (kcat/Km), both in the
absence and presence of C5.}

  abstract =	 {Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized inside the nucleus in 
                  such a way that only a subset of the genome is expressed in 
                  any given cell type, but the details of this organization 
                  are largely unknown. SATB1 ('special AT-rich sequence 
                  binding 1'), a protein found predominantly in thymocytes, 
                  regulates genes by folding chromatin into loop domains, 
                  tethering specialized DNA elements to an SATB1 network 
                  structure. Ablation of SATB1 by gene targeting results in 
                  temporal and spatial mis-expression of numerous genes and 
                  arrested T-cell development, suggesting that SATB1 is a 
                  cell-type specific global gene regulator. Here we show that 
                  SATB1 targets chromatin remodelling to the IL-2Ralpha 
                  ('interleukin-2 receptor alpha') gene, which is ectopically 
                  transcribed in SATB1 null thymocytes. SATB1 recruits the 
                  histone deacetylase contained in the NURD chromatin 
                  remodelling complex to a SATB1-bound site in the IL-2Ralpha 
                  locus, and mediates the specific deacetylation of histones 
                  in a large domain within the locus. SATB1 also targets ACF1 
                  and ISWI, subunits of CHRAC and ACF nucleosome mobilizing 
                  complexes, to this specific site and regulates nucleosome 
                  positioning over seven kilobases. SATB1 defines a class of 
                  transcriptional regulators that function as a 'landing 
                  platform' for several chromatin remodelling enzymes and 
                  hence regulate large chromatin domains.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: An important step in unravelling the 
                  transcriptional regulatory network of an organism is to 
                  identify, for each transcription factor, all of its DNA 
                  binding sites. Several approaches are commonly used in 
                  searching for a transcription factor's binding sites, 
                  including consensus sequences and position-specific scoring 
                  matrices (PSSMs). Additionally, methods that compute the 
                  average number of nucleotide matches between a putative site 
                  and all known sites can be employed. Such basic approaches 
                  can all be naturally extended by incorporating pairwise 
                  nucleotide dependencies and per-position information 
                  content. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of 
                  these basic approaches and their extensions in finding 
                  binding sites for a transcription factor of interest without 
                  erroneously identifying other genomic sequences. RESULTS: In 
                  cross-validation testing on a data set of E. coli 
                  transcription factors and their binding sites, we show that 
                  there are statistically significant differences in how well 
                  various methods identify transcription factor binding sites. 
                  The use of per-position information content improves the 
                  performance of all basic approaches. Furthermore, including 
                  local pairwise nucleotide dependencies within binding site 
                  models results in statistically significant performance 
                  improvements for approaches based on nucleotide matches. 
                  Based on our analysis, the best results when searching for 
                  DNA binding sites of a particular transcription factor are 
                  obtained by methods that incorporate both information 
                  content and local pairwise correlations. AVAILABILITY: The

                  artificial hairpins on pre-mRNA splicing in protoplasts of a 
                  dicot plant, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Hairpins with a 
                  potential to form 18 or 24 bp stems strongly inhibit 
                  splicing when they sequester the 5' splice site or are 
                  placed in the middle of short introns. However, similar 24 
                  bp hairpins sequestering the 3' splice site do not prevent 
                  this site from being used as an acceptor. Utilization of the 
                  stem-located 3' site requires that the base of the stem is 
                  separated from the upstream 5' splice site by a minimum of 
                  approximately 45 nucleotides and that another 'helper' 3' 
                  splice site is present downstream of the stem. The results

                  may have a potential to unfold secondary structure present 
                  in the downstream portion of the intron, prior to or at the 
                  step of the 3' splice site selection. The finding that the 
                  helper 3' site is required for utilization of the 
                  stem-located acceptor confirms and extends previous 
                  observations, obtained with HeLa cell in vitro splicing 
                  systems, indicating that the 3' splice site may be 
                  recognized at least twice during spliceosome assembly.}

computer-annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL consists of entries in
SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding
sequences (CDSs) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, except the CDSs
already included in SWISS-PROT. We also describe the Human Proteomics

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The Jing-Mai (variously translated as the
		  Channel, Vessel or Meridians), as described by traditional
		  Chinese medicine, probably exists and has represented the
		  connections between various parts of human body during
		  embryonic development. According to the Chinese theories,
		  there are 14 major Jing-Mai within the human body, of which
		  four are directly connected with the Heart. METHODS: The
		  described paths of the four Jing-Mai were compared with
		  features of congenital syndromes involving particular types
		  of congenital heart defects. RESULTS: Specific correlation
		  seem to exist between such four Jing-Mai and known
		  developmental mechanisms underlying various congenital
		  heart defects: the Kidney Jing-Mai-ectomesenchymal tissue
		  migration abnormalities; the Spleen Jing-Mai-situs and
		  looping defects; the Heart Jing-Mai-abnormal cell death;
		  the Small Intestine Jing-Mai (and the Heart
		  Jing-Mai)-extracellular matrix anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: The
		  Chinese theories seem to provide some intriguing insights
		  into the pathogeneses of congenital heart defects. The
		  Jing-Mai seems to distinguish from, but nevertheless have a
		  close relationship with the blood vessels. Utilization of
		  the Jing-Mai will probably enable a better understanding
		  and development of new treatments for cardiovascular

                  efficient functional characterisation of
                  hypothetical proteins. Here, our goal is to map
                  specific sequence patterns to putative functional
                  classes. The evolutionary signal stands out most
                  clearly in a maximally diverse set of
                  homologues. This diversity, however, leads to a
                  number of technical difficulties. The targeted
                  patterns--as gleaned from structure comparisons--are
                  too sparse for statistically significant signals of
                  sequence similarity and accurate multiple sequence
                  alignment. Results: We address this problem by a
                  fuzzy alignment model, which probabilistically
                  assigns residues to structurally equivalent
                  positions (attributes) of the proteins. We then
                  apply multivariate analysis to the `attributes x
                  proteins' matrix. The dimensionality of the space is
                  reduced using non-negative matrix factorization. The
                  method is general, fully automatic and works without
                  assumptions about pattern density, minimum support,
                  explicit multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees,
                  etc. We demonstrate the discovery of biologically
                  meaningful patterns in an extremely diverse
                  superfamily related to urease. Contact:

  volume = {80},
  pages = {5747--5756},

  abstract = {In plants, RNA silencing (RNA interference) is an efficient antiviral
	system, and therefore successful virus infection requires suppression
	of silencing. Although many viral silencing suppressors have been
	identified, the molecular basis of silencing suppression is poorly
	understood. It is proposed that various suppressors inhibit RNA silencing
	by targeting different steps. However, as double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)
	play key roles in silencing, it was speculated that dsRNA binding
	might be a general silencing suppression strategy. Indeed, it was
	shown that the related aureusvirus P14 and tombusvirus P19 suppressors
	are dsRNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, P14 is a size-independent
	dsRNA-binding protein, while P19 binds only 21-nucleotide ds-sRNAs
	(small dsRNAs having 2-nucleotide 3' overhangs), the specificity
	determinant of the silencing system. Much evidence supports the idea
	that P19 inhibits silencing by sequestering silencing-generated viral
	ds-sRNAs. In this study we wanted to test the hypothesis that dsRNA
	binding is a general silencing suppression strategy. Here we show
	that many plant viral silencing suppressors bind dsRNAs. Beet yellows
	virus Peanut P21, clump virus P15, Barley stripe mosaic virus gammaB,
	and Tobacco etch virus HC-Pro, like P19, bind ds-sRNAs size-selectively,
	while Turnip crinkle virus CP is a size-independent dsRNA-binding
	protein, which binds long dsRNAs as well as ds-sRNAs. We propose
	that size-selective ds-sRNA-binding suppressors inhibit silencing
	by sequestering viral ds-sRNAs, whereas size-independent dsRNA-binding
	suppressors inactivate silencing by sequestering long dsRNA precursors
	of viral sRNAs and/or by binding ds-sRNAs. The findings that many
	unrelated silencing suppressors bind dsRNA suggest that dsRNA binding
	is a general silencing suppression strategy which has evolved independently
	many times.},

                  significant fluctuations across eukaryotic genes. In this 
                  paper, we investigate nucleotide variation across an 
                  averaged representation of all known human genes. Such a 
                  representation allows us to average out random fluctuations 
                  that constitute noise and uncover remarkable systematic 
                  trends in nucleotide distributions, particularly near 
                  boundaries between genetic elements--the promoter, exons, 
                  and introns. We propose that such variations result from 
                  differential mutational pressures and from the presence of 
                  specific regulatory motifs, such as transcription and 
                  splicing factor binding sites. Specifically, we observe 
                  significant GC and TA biases (excess of G over C and T over 
                  A) in noncoding regions of genes. Such biases are most 
                  probably caused by transcription-coupled mismatch repair, an 
                  effect that has recently been detected in mammalian genes. 
                  Subsequently, we examine the distribution of all 
                  hexanucleotides and identify motifs that are overrepresented 
                  within regulatory regions. By clustering and aligning such 
                  sequences, we recognize families of putative regulatory 
                  elements involved in exonic and intronic splicing control, 
                  and 3' mRNA processing. Some of our motifs have been 
                  identified in prior theoretical and experimental studies, 
                  thus validating our approach, but we detect several novel 
                  sequences that we propose as candidates for future 
                  functional assays and mutation screens for genetic 
                  disorders.}

	The extent of RNA knockdown was measured for 22 genes by quantitative

	knockdown showed that (i) duplexes targeting the middle of the coding
	sequence silenced significantly poorer, (ii) silencing by duplexes

	sequence, (iii) pooling of four or five duplexes per gene was remarkably
	efficient in knocking down gene expression and (iv) among duplexes
	that achieved a >70% knockdown of the mRNA there were strong nucleotide
	preferences at specific positions, most notably positions 11 (G or
	C) and 19 (T) of the siRNA duplex. Finally, in a proof-of-principle

	which have appeared up to now in the biological literature. Its power
	is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: It is currently believed that the human genome contains about twice as much non-coding functional regions as it does protein-coding genes, yet our understanding of these regions is very limited. RESULTS: We examine the intersection between syntenically conserved sequences in the human, mouse and rat genomes, and sequence similarities within the human genome itself, in search of families of non-protein-coding elements. For this purpose we develop a graph theoretic clustering algorithm, akin to the highly successful methods used in elucidating protein sequence family relationships. The algorithm is applied to a highly filtered set of about 700 000 human-rodent evolutionarily conserved regions, not resembling any known coding sequence, which encompasses 3.7\% of the human genome. From these, we obtain roughly 12 000 non-singleton clusters, dense in significant sequence similarities. Further analysis of genomic location, evidence of transcription and RNA secondary structure reveals many clusters to be significantly homogeneous in one or more characteristics. This subset of the highly conserved non-protein-coding elements in the human genome thus contains rich family-like structures, which merit in-depth analysis.

  abstract =	 {For eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs, it has been proposed 
                  that the SECIS element in the 3'-UTR is required for 
                  recognition of UGA as a Sec codon. Some proteins which bind 
                  to SECIS (SBP) have been reported. However, it is not clear 
                  how the SECIS element in the 3'-UTR can mediate Sec 
                  insertion far at the in-frame UGA Sec codons. The idea that 
                  there must be a signal near the UGA Sec codon is still being 
                  considered. Therefore, we searched for a protein which binds 
                  to an RNA sequence surrounding the UGA Sec codon on human 
                  GPx mRNA. We found a protein, prepared from bovine brain 
                  microsomes, which strongly bound to the RNA fragment 
                  upstream of the UGA Sec codon but not to the RNA sequence 
                  downstream of the UGA codon. This protein also bound to the 
                  SECIS sequence in the 3'-UTR of human GPx, and this binding 
                  to SECIS was competed with the RNA fragment upstream of the 
                  UGA Sec codon. We also obtained the similar results with the 
                  RNA fragments of type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'DI) 
                  mRNAs. Comparison of such RNA fragments with SECIS fragments 
                  revealed similarities in the region upstream of the in-frame 
                  UGA Sec codon of several Se-protein mRNAs. The study thus 
                  favors a novel model of Sec incorporation at the UGA Sec 
                  codon that involves the regions upstream of the UGA codon of 
                  mRNAs of mammalian selenoproteins. This model explains that 
                  the stem-loop structure covering the UGA codon is recognized 
                  by SBP and how the UGA Sec codon escapes from attack by eRF.}

                  complete ensemble of genes is a main goal of
                  deciphering the digital information stored in the
                  human genome. Many algorithms for computational gene
                  prediction have been described, ultimately derived
                  from two basic concepts: (1) modeling gene structure
                  and (2) recognizing sequence similarity. Successful
                  hybrid methods combining these two concepts have
                  also been developed. We present a third orthogonal
                  approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the
                  genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated
                  over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms
                  based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER,
                  which quantify mutational strand biases caused by
                  transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and
                  PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection
                  against polyadenylation signals. We combined these
                  algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST,
                  which we used to predict the location and
                  orientation of thousands of putative transcription
                  units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly
                  predicted transcriptional units do not appear to
                  code for proteins. The new algorithms are
                  particularly apt at detecting genes with long
                  introns and lacking sequence conservation. They
                  therefore complement existing gene prediction
                  methods and will help identify functional
                  transcripts within many apparent \&quot;genomic
                  deserts.\&quot;}

   Abstract="Evolution from unicellular organisms to larger multicellular ones requires matching their needs to the rate of exchange of molecular nutrients with the environment. This logistic problem poses a severe constraint on development. For organisms whose body plan is a spherical shell, such as the volvocine green algae, the current (molecules per second) of needed nutrients grows quadratically with radius, whereas the rate at which diffusion alone exchanges molecules grows linearly, leading to a bottleneck radius beyond which the diffusive current cannot meet metabolic demands. By using Volvox carteri, we examine the role that advection of fluid by the coordinated beating of surface-mounted flagella plays in enhancing nutrient uptake and show that it generates a boundary layer of concentration of the diffusing solute. That concentration gradient produces an exchange rate that is quadratic in the radius, as required, thus circumventing the bottleneck and facilitating evolutionary transitions to multicellularity and germ-soma differentiation in the volvocalean green algae."

	between these regulatory RNAs and their target mRNAs requires the
	Sm-like Hfq protein which most likely functions as an RNA chaperone
	to increase RNA unfolding or local target RNA concentration. Here
	we summarize the physiological roles of the basepairing RNAs, examine
	their prevalence in bacteria and discuss unresolved questions regarding
	their mechanisms of action.},

With the discovery of riboswitches, RNA no longer takes a backseat to protein when it comes to affecting gene expression. Riboswitches bind directly to cellular metabolites with exceptional specificity and affinity, and exert control over gene expression through ligand-induced conformational changes in RNA structure. Riboswitches now represent a widespread mechanism by which cells monitor their metabolic state and facilely alter gene expression in response to changing conditions.}",
