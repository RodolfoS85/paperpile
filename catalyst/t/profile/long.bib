  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable prediction of RNA-RNA binding energies is crucial,
	e.g. for the understanding on RNAi, microRNA-mRNA binding and antisense
	interactions. The thermodynamics of such RNA-RNA interactions can
	be understood as the sum of two energy contributions: (1) the energy
	necessary to 'open' the binding site and (2) the energy gained from
	hybridization. METHODS: We present an extension of the standard partition
	function approach to RNA secondary structures that computes the probabilities
	Pu[i, j] that a sequence interval [i, j] is unpaired. RESULTS: Comparison
	with experimental data shows that Pu[i, j] can be applied as a significant
	determinant of local target site accessibility for RNA interference
	(RNAi). Furthermore, these quantities can be used to rigorously determine
	binding free energies of short oligomers to large mRNA targets. The
	resource consumption is comparable with a single partition function
	computation for the large target molecule. We can show that RNAi
	efficiency correlates well with the binding energies of siRNAs to
	their respective mRNA target. AVAILABILITY: RNAup will be distributed

                  helix-loop-helix regulatory factors involved in controlling 
                  myogenesis. We here describe various protein complexes that 
                  increase the affinity of myogenin for DNA. We mixed an 
                  oligonucleotide containing a degenerate center large enough 
                  to accommodate multiple binding sites with crude myotube 
                  nuclear extracts and used cyclic amplification and selection 
                  of targets with an antimyogenin monoclonal antibody to 
                  isolate protein-DNA complexes. Since each cycle of selection 
                  results in the enrichment for the sequences with the highest 
                  affinity, we isolated multicomponent sites in which myogenin 
                  binding was increased by its interaction with other DNA 
                  binding proteins. Myogenin interacts with members of the 
                  nuclear factor 1 family, the muscle-specific factor 
                  myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor 2, and another 
                  factor, COMP1 (cooperates with myogenic proteins 1), that 
                  binds to the sequence TGATTGAC. Myogenin also exhibits 
                  cooperative binding with other proteins that recognize 
                  CANNTG motifs, and various constraints on spacing and 
                  orientation were observed. The application of this approach 
                  to other transcription factors should not only help identify 
                  the different functions of myogenin versus other members of 
                  the muscle basic helix-loop-helix regulatory family but also 
                  help define the general combinatorial mechanisms involved in 
                  eukaryotic gene regulation.}

                  the principal secretory product of the vertebrate thyroid, 
                  its essential metabolic and developmental effects are all 
                  mediated by 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), which is produced 
                  from the prohormone by 5'-deiodination. The type-I 
                  iodothyronine deiodinase, a thiol-requiring 
                  propylthiouracil-sensitive oxidoreductase, is found mainly 
                  in liver and kidney and provides most of the circulating 
                  T3(1) but so far this enzyme has not been purified. Using 
                  expression cloning in the Xenopus oocyte, we have isolated a 
                  2.1-kilobase complementary DNA for this deiodinase from a 
                  rat liver cDNA library. The kinetic properties of the 
                  protein expressed in transient assay systems, the tissue 
                  distribution of the messenger RNA, and its changes with 
                  thyroid status, all confirm its identity. We find that the 
                  mRNA for this enzyme contains a UGA codon for selenocysteine 
                  which is necessary for maximal enzyme activity. This 
                  explains why conversion of T4 to T3 is impaired in 
                  experimental selenium deficiency and identifies an essential 
                  role for this trace element in thyroid hormone action.}

                  primary sequence can be separated into two subproblems: 
                  generation of a library of possible folds and specification 
                  of a best fold given the library. A distance geometry 
                  procedure based on random pairwise metrization with good 
                  sampling properties was used to generate a library of 500 
                  possible structures for each of 11 small helical proteins. 
                  The input to distance geometry consisted of sets of 
                  restraints to enforce predicted helical secondary structure 
                  and a generic range of 5 to 11 A between predicted contact 
                  residues on all pairs of helices. For each of the 11 
                  targets, the resulting library contained structures with low 
                  RMSD versus the native structure. Near-native sampling was 
                  enhanced by at least three orders of magnitude compared to a 
                  random sampling of compact folds. All library members were 
                  scored with a combination of an all-atom distance-dependent 
                  function, a residue pair-potential, and a hydrophobicity 
                  function. In six of the 11 cases, the best-ranking fold was 
                  considered to be near native. Each library was also reduced 
                  to a final ab initio prediction via consensus distance 
                  geometry performed over the 50 best-ranking structures from 
                  the full set of 500. The consensus results were of generally 
                  higher quality, yielding six predictions within 6.5 A of the 
                  native fold. These favorable predictions corresponded to 
                  those for which the correlation between the RMSD and the 
                  scoring function were highest. The advantage of the reported 
                  methodology is its extreme simplicity and potential for 
                  including other types of structural restraints.}

                  transcriptional interference and even transcriptional 
                  initiation. However, how this occurs is poorly understood. 
                  Recently, in vivo analysis of transcriptional termination 
                  for the human beta-globin gene revealed a new 
                  phenomenon-co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). This primary 
                  cleavage event within beta-globin pre-messenger RNA, 
                  downstream of the poly(A) site, is critical for efficient 
                  transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II. Here we 
                  show that the CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene 
                  involves an RNA self-cleaving activity. We characterize the 
                  autocatalytic core of the CoTC ribozyme and show its 
                  functional role in efficient termination in vivo. The 
                  identified core CoTC is highly conserved in the 3' flanking 
                  regions of other primate beta-globin genes. Functionally, it 
                  resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes 
                  described for the protein-encoding genes from the 
                  myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum, 
                  indicating evolutionary conservation of this molecular 
                  process. We predict that regulated autocatalytic cleavage 
                  elements within pre-mRNAs may be a general phenomenon and 
                  that functionally it may provide the entry point for 
                  exonucleases involved in mRNA maturation, turnover and, in 
                  particular, transcriptional termination.}

  abstract = {In RNAi (RNA interference), siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) are loaded
	into the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which then mediates
	endonucleolytic cleavage of complementary target RNAs. Although RNAi
	has become one of the most powerful tools in molecular biology to
	assess gene function, there remains a great number of ineffective
	siRNAs. It is already known that the assembly and activation of RISC
	is a crucial determinant of RNAi activity, but downstream effects
	such as target accessibility have not been analysed extensively.
	Therefore we assessed the effect of target site accessibility and
	found that it significantly improves the potency of siRNAs. Similarly,
	miRNAs (microRNAs) act by repressing protein synthesis through imperfect
	base-pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs.
	We found that predicted target sites reside in regions of high accessibility
	and tested whether this criterion could be used in the search of
	functional miRNA targets. In addition, we performed reporter gene
	assays to test whether accessibility correlates with measured mRNA
	suppression levels. The results of our initial study suggest that
	secondary structures might add a so far underrepresented layer of
	complexity in the recognition of RNA targets by miRNAs.},

  abstract =	 {Transcription factor-induced DNA bending is important in 
                  determining local promoter architecture and it is thought to 
                  be a key determinant of their function. The human MADS-box 
                  transcription factors serum response factor and MEF2A 
                  exhibit different propensities to bend their binding sites. 
                  Here, we have investigated the ability of several family 
                  members from different species to bend DNA and the molecular 
                  mechanisms underlying this process. Differential DNA bending 
                  is observed in yeast and plant MADS-box proteins. Like 
                  MEF2A, the yeast proteins Rlm1 and Smp1 exhibit low DNA 
                  bending propensities. A comparison of serum response factor 
                  and SQUA reveals that the basic mechanisms of DNA bending 
                  appear to be conserved between these proteins, although 
                  several key differences do exist. In contrast to serum 
                  response factor, SQUA bends DNA in a DNA sequence-dependent 
                  manner. In both proteins, protein-DNA contacts made between 
                  residues in the beta-loop and the N-terminal end of the 
                  recognition helices in the MADS-box are the major 
                  determinants of DNA bending. However, although residues 
                  which are involved in DNA bending are predicted to be 
                  located in similar positions in their tertiary structures, 
                  different residues dictate bending by each protein. Further 
                  complexities are uncovered in the links between the DNA 
                  bending propensity and the binding specificity. In

                  stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. This common feature 
                  makes it difficult for signal peptide and transmembrane 
                  helix predictors to correctly assign identity to stretches 
                  of hydrophobic residues near the N-terminal methionine of a 
                  protein sequence. The inability to reliably distinguish 
                  between N-terminal transmembrane helix and signal peptide is 
                  an error with serious consequences for the prediction of 
                  protein secretory status or transmembrane topology. In this 
                  study, we report a new method for differentiating protein 
                  N-terminal signal peptides and transmembrane helices. Based 
                  on the sequence features extracted from hydrophobic regions 
                  (amino acid frequency, hydrophobicity, and the start 
                  position), we set up discriminant functions and examined 
                  them on non-redundant datasets with jackknife tests. This 
                  method can incorporate other signal peptide prediction 
                  methods and achieve higher prediction accuracy. For 
                  Gram-negative bacterial proteins, 95.7% of N-terminal signal 
                  peptides and transmembrane helices can be correctly 
                  predicted (coefficient 0.90). Given a sensitivity of 90%, 
                  transmembrane helices can be identified from signal peptides 
                  with a precision of 99% (coefficient 0.92). For eukaryotic 
                  proteins, 94.2% of N-terminal signal peptides and 
                  transmembrane helices can be correctly predicted with 
                  coefficient 0.83. Given a sensitivity of 90%, transmembrane 
                  helices can be identified from signal peptides with a 
                  precision of 87% (coefficient 0.85). The method can be used 
                  to complement current transmembrane protein prediction and 
                  signal peptide prediction methods to improve their 
                  prediction accuracies.}

	the mRNA, in microRNA target recognition. We experimentally show
	that mutations diminishing target accessibility substantially reduce
	microRNA-mediated translational repression, with effects comparable
	to those of mutations that disrupt sequence complementarity. We devise
	a parameter-free model for microRNA-target interaction that computes
	the difference between the free energy gained from the formation
	of the microRNA-target duplex and the energetic cost of unpairing
	the target to make it accessible to the microRNA. This model explains
	the variability in our experiments, predicts validated targets more
	accurately than existing algorithms, and shows that genomes accommodate
	site accessibility by preferentially positioning targets in highly
	accessible regions. Our study thus demonstrates that target accessibility
	is a critical factor in microRNA function.},

title = "{Structure and nucleic-acid binding of the Drosophila Argonaute 2 PAZ domain}",
abstract = "{RNA interference is a conserved mechanism that regulates gene expression in response to the presence of double-stranded (ds)RNAs. The RNase III-like enzyme Dicer first cleaves dsRNA into 21-23-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In the effector step, the multimeric RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) identifies messenger RNAs homologous to the siRNAs and promotes their degradation. The Argonaute 2 protein (Ago2) is a critical component of RISC. Both Argonaute and Dicer family proteins contain a common PAZ domain whose function is unknown. Here we present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Ago2 PAZ domain. This domain adopts a nucleic-acid-binding fold that is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues. The nucleic-acid-binding patch is located in a cleft between the surface of a central beta-barrel and a conserved module comprising strands beta3, beta4 and helix alpha3. Because critical structural residues and the binding surface are conserved, we suggest that PAZ domains in all members of the Argonaute and Dicer families adopt a similar fold with nucleic-acid binding function, and that this plays an important part in gene silencing.}",

  abstract =	 {Previously, we introduced a neural network system 
                  predicting locations of transmembrane helices (HTMs) based 
                  on evolutionary profiles (PHDhtm, Rost B, Casadio R, 
                  Fariselli P, Sander C, 1995, Protein Sci 4:521-533). Here, 
                  we describe an improvement and an extension of that system. 
                  The improvement is achieved by a dynamic programming-like 
                  algorithm that optimizes helices compatible with the neural 
                  network output. The extension is the prediction of topology 
                  (orientation of first loop region with respect to membrane) 
                  by applying to the refined prediction the observation that 
                  positively charged residues are more abundant in 
                  extra-cytoplasmic regions. Furthermore, we introduce a 
                  method to reduce the number of false positives, i.e., 
                  proteins falsely predicted with membrane helices. The 
                  evaluation of prediction accuracy is based on a 
                  cross-validation and a double-blind test set (in total 131 
                  proteins). The final method appears to be more accurate than 
                  other methods published: (1) For almost 89% (+/-3%) of the 
                  test proteins, all HTMs are predicted correctly. (2) For 
                  more than 86% (+/-3%) of the proteins, topology is predicted 
                  correctly. (3) We define reliability indices that correlate 
                  with prediction accuracy: for one half of the proteins, 
                  segment accuracy raises to 98%; and for two-thirds, accuracy 
                  of topology prediction is 95%. (4) The rate of proteins for 
                  which HTMs are predicted falsely is below 2% (+/-1%). 
                  Finally, the method is applied to 1,616 sequences of 
                  Haemophilus influenzae. We predict 19% of the genome 
                  sequences to contain one or more HTMs. This appears to be 
                  lower than what we predicted previously for the yeast VIII 
                  chromosome (about 25%).}

                  supramolecular systems based on micelles and
                  vesicles (or liposomes); the processes are related
                  to possible prebiotic transformations involving the
                  forerunners of biological cells. Here we construct
                  and study a kinetic model which describes both the
                  formation and self- reproduction oi vesicles. Until
                  now, a detailed mechanistic understanding of vesicle
                  formation has been lacking. Our approach is based on
                  a novel generalisation of the Becker- Doring cluster
                  equations which describe the stepwise growth and
                  fragmentation of vesicular structures. The
                  non-linear kinetic model we present is highly
                  complex and involves many microscopic processes;
                  however, by means of a systematic contraction of the
                  complete set of kinetic equations to the macroscopic
                  limit, me show that the model correctly captures the
                  experimentally observed behaviour. }

  abstract =	 "We explore the effect of dimensionality on the
                  nearest neighbor problem. We show that under a broad
                  set of conditions (much broader than independent and
                  identically distributed dimensions), as
                  dimensionality increases, the distance to the
                  nearest data point approaches the distance to the
                  farthest data point. To provide a practical
                  perspective, we present empirical results on both
                  real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that
                  this effect can occur for as few as 10-15
                  dimensions. These results should not be interpreted
                  to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never
                  meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying
                  some high-dimensional workloads for which this
                  effect does not occur. However, our results do
                  emphasize that the methodology used almost
                  universally in the database literature to evaluate
                  high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and
                  should be modified. In particular, most such
                  techniques proposed in the literature are not
                  evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are
                  evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor
                  is not meaningful. Often, even the reported
                  experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that
                  linear scan would outperform the techniques being
                  proposed on the workloads studied in high (10-15)

	and cost-effective approach to elucidate the transcriptome of an

	EST data management and analysis. The pipeline uses a 'distributed
	control approach' in which the most appropriate bioinformatics tools
	are implemented over different dedicated processors. Species-specific
	repeat masking and conceptual translation are in-built. ESTExplorer
	accepts a set of ESTs in FASTA format which can be analysed using
	programs selected by the user. After pre-processing and assembly,
	the dataset is annotated at the nucleotide and protein levels, following
	conceptual translation. Users may optionally provide ESTExplorer
	with assembled contigs for annotation purposes. Functionally annotated
	contigs/ESTs can be analysed individually. The overall outputs are
	gene ontologies, protein functional identifications in terms of mapping
	to protein domains and metabolic pathways. ESTExplorer has been applied
	successfully to annotate large EST datasets from parasitic nematodes
	and to identify novel genes as potential targets for parasite intervention.
	ESTExplorer runs on a Linux cluster and is freely available for the

Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity by
using a substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one
amino acid with another. The most widely used matrices are based on the
Dayhoff model of evolutionary rates. Using a different approach, we have
derived substitution matrices from about 2000 blocks of aligned sequence
segments characterizing more than 500 groups of related proteins. This led
to marked improvements in alignments and in searches using queries from
each of the groups.

Monitoring biocatalysed reactions and metabolic pathways using NMR
spectroscopy is of growing interest. As a non-invasive analytical method
providing simultaneous information about intracellular and extracellular
constituents, it is superior to other analytical techniques and has a wide
range of applications: kinetics and stoichiometrics of metabolic events,
metabolic fluxes and enzyme activities can be detected in situ or after
taking a sample from the biotransformation mixture. New NMR pulse
sequences provide even more valuable experiments in these fields. Research
topics range from the monitoring of polymer formation to fermentations
producing beverages or antibiotics. Routine monitoring of industrial
fermentations by NMR seems to be imminent.}

   abstract = {Some genes produce noncoding transcripts that function directly as structural, regulatory, or even catalytic RNAs [1, 2]. Unlike protein-coding genes, which can be detected as open reading frames with distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene sequences have no obvious inherent statistical biases [3]. Thus, genome sequence analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes, but any novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we describe a computational comparative genomic screen for ncRNA genes. The key idea is to distinguish conserved RNA secondary structures from a background of other conserved sequences using probabilistic models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise sequence alignments. We report the first whole-genome screen for ncRNA genes done with this method, in which we applied it to the \&quot;intergenic\&quot; spacers of Escherichia coli using comparative sequence data from four related bacteria. Starting from \&gt;23,000 conserved interspecies pairwise alignments, the screen predicted 275 candidate structural RNA loci. A sample of 49 candidate loci was assayed experimentally. At least 11 loci expressed small, apparently noncoding RNA transcripts of unknown function. Our computational approach may be used to discover structural ncRNA genes in any genome for which appropriate comparative genome sequence data are available.}

                  complexity of the human genome/proteome, we have 
                  systematically analyzed intron phase distributions in the 
                  coding sequence of human protein domains. We found that 
                  introns at the boundaries of domains show high excess of 
                  symmetrical phase combinations (i.e., 0-0, 1-1, and 2-2), 
                  whereas nonboundary introns show no excess symmetry. This 
                  suggests that exon shuffling has primarily involved 
                  rearrangement of structural and functional domains as a 
                  whole. Furthermore, we found that domains flanked by phase 1 
                  introns have dramatically expanded in the human genome due 
                  to domain shuffling and that 1-1 symmetrical domains and 
                  domain families are nonrandomly distributed with respect to 
                  their age. The predominance and extracellular location of 
                  1-1 symmetrical domains among domains specific to metazoans 
                  suggests that they are associated with the rise of 
                  multicellularity. On the other hand, 0-0 symmetrical domains 
                  tend to be over-represented among ancient protein domains 
                  that are shared between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
                  kingdoms, which is compatible with the suggestion of 
                  primordial domain shuffling in the progenote. To see whether 
                  the human data reflect general genomic patterns of 
                  metazoans, similar analyses were done for the nematode 
                  Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the C. elegans data 
                  generally concur with the human patterns, we identified 
                  fewer intron-bounded domains in this organism, consistent 
                  with the lower complexity of C. elegans genes. [The

	to avoid cross-hybridization of highly similar sequences. We developed
	an approach to determine the optimal number and length of gene-specific
	probes for accurate transcriptional profiling studies. The study
	surveyed probe lengths from 25 to 1000 nt. Long probes yield better
	signal intensity than short probes. The signal intensity of short
	probes can be improved by addition of spacers or using higher probe
	concentration for spotting. We also found that accurate gene expression
	measurement can be achieved with multiple probes per gene and fewer
	probes are needed if longer probes rather than shorter probes are
	used. Based on theoretical considerations that were confirmed experimentally,
	our results showed that 150mer is the optimal probe length for expression
	measurement. Gene-specific probes can be identified using a computational
	approach for 150mer probes and they can be treated like long c{DNA}
	probes in terms of the hybridization reaction for high sensitivity
	detection. Our experimental data also show that probes which do not
	generate good signal intensity give erroneous expression ratio measurement
	results. To use microarray probes without experimental validation,
	gene-specific probes approximately 150mer in length are necessary.
	However, shorter oligonucleotide probes also work well in gene expression
	analysis if the probes are validated by experimental selection or
	if multiple probes per gene are used for expression measurement.},

                  secondary structure of two or more nucleic acid molecules,

                  secondary structures of interacting RNA molecules drawn from 
                  the literature. Analysis of our tools on 17 sequences of up 
                  to 200 nucleotides that do not form pseudoknots shows that 
                  they have 79% accuracy, on average, for the minimum free

                  foldings is taken, the average accuracy increases to 91%. 
                  The accuracy decreases as the sequences increase in length

                  structure prediction, and the sub-optimal folding algorithm

                  between the pattern suggested by the fossil record

                  for plants, animals, fungi, and the deepest branches

                  place constraints on the increase in complexity

                  fungi or plants, (iv) diplomonads, euglenozoans, and

                  (supergene). Different time estimation methods
                  yielded similar results (within 5\%):
                  vertebrate-arthropod (964 million years ago, Ma),
                  Cnidaria-Bilateria (1,298 Ma), Porifera-Eumetozoa
                  (1,351 Ma), Pyrenomycetes-Plectomycetes (551 Ma),
                  Candida-Saccharomyces (723 Ma),
                  Hemiascomycetes-filamentous Ascomycota (982 Ma),
                  Basidiomycota-Ascomycota (968 Ma),
                  Mucorales-Basidiomycota (947 Ma), Fungi-Animalia
                  (1,513 Ma), mosses-vascular plants (707 Ma),
                  Chlorophyta-Tracheophyta (968 Ma),
                  Rhodophyta-Chlorophyta+Embryophyta (1,428 Ma),
                  Plantae-Animalia (1,609 Ma),
                  Alveolata-plants+animals+fungi (1,973 Ma),
                  Euglenozoa-plants+animals+fungi (1,961 Ma), and
                  Giardia-plants+animals+fungi (2,309 Ma). By
                  extrapolation, mitochondria arose approximately
                  2300-1800 Ma and plastids arose 1600-1500
                  Ma. Estimates of the maximum number of cell types of
                  common ancestors, combined with divergence times,
                  showed an increase from two cell types at 2500 Ma to
                  approximately 10 types at 1500 Ma and 50 cell types
                  at approximately 1000 Ma. CONCLUSIONS: The results
                  suggest that oxygen levels in the environment, and
                  the ability of eukaryotes to extract energy from
                  oxygen, as well as produce oxygen, were key factors
                  in the rise of complex multicellular
                  life. Mitochondria and organisms with more than 2-3
                  cell types appeared soon after the initial increase
                  in oxygen levels at 2300 Ma. The addition of
                  plastids at 1500 Ma, allowing eukaryotes to produce
                  oxygen, preceded the major rise in complexity.}",

Signal finding (pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences) is a
fundamental problem in both computer science and molecular biology with
important applications in locating regulatory sites and drug target
identification. Despite many studies, this problem is far from being
resolved: most signals in DNA sequences are so complicated that we don't
yet have good models or reliable algorithms for their recognition. We
complement existing statistical and machine learning approaches to this
problem by a combinatorial approach that proved to be successful in
identifying very subtle signals.}

	forms an RNA-RNA duplex with ptsG mRNA to exert its regulatory function.
	Specific single nucleotide substitutions around the Shine-Dalgarno
	(SD) sequence of ptsG completely eliminated SgrS action while compensatory
	mutations in SgrS restored it. A systematic mutational analysis of
	both ptsG and SgrS RNAs revealed that six base pairs around SD sequence
	of ptsG are particularly important for SgrS action. We also showed
	in vitro that SgrS forms a stable duplex with the ptsG mRNA, and

MOTIVATION: We extend the standard 'Sequence Logo' method of Schneider and
Stevens (Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 6097-6100, 1990) to incorporate prior
frequencies on the bases, allow for gaps in the alignments, and indicate
the mutual information of base-paired regions in RNA. RESULTS: Given an
alignment of RNA sequences with the base pairings indicated, the program
will calculate the information at each position, including the mutual
information of the base pairs, and display the results in a 'Structure
Logo'. Alignments without base pairing can also be displayed in a
'Sequence Logo', but still allowing gaps and incorporating prior
frequencies if desired. AVAILABILITY: The code is available from, and an
Internet server can be used to run the program at,

	for 68 different hybrid sequences (136 single-stranded oligonucleotides)

                  Alternative splicing is another means of evolutionary 
                  innovation in eukaryotes, which allows a single gene to 
                  encode functionally diverse proteins. We investigate a 
                  connection between these two evolutionary phenomena. For 
                  approximately 10% of the described cases of substitution 
                  alternative splicing, such that either one or another amino 
                  acid sequence is included into the protein, evidence of 
                  origin by tandem exon duplication was found. This is a 
                  conservative estimate because alternative exons are 
                  typically short and, on many occasions, duplicates may have 
                  diverged beyond recognition. Dating exon duplications 
                  through a combination of the available experimental data on 
                  alternative splicing in orthologous genes from different 
                  species and computational analysis indicates that most of 
                  the duplications antedate at least the radiation of 
                  mammalian orders or even the radiation of vertebrate 
                  classes. At present, tandem exon duplication is the only 
                  mechanism of evolution of substitution alternative splicing 
                  that can be specifically demonstrated. Along with gene 
                  duplication, this could be a major route for generating 
                  functional diversity during evolution of multicellular 
                  eukaryotes.}

	be the initiation site for the dimerization of the retroviral genomic
	RNA. The aim of this study is to check the stability in solution
	of different experimental dimeric structures available in the literature.
	Two kinds of dimer have been evidenced: an extended duplex looking
	like a double helix with two internal bulges and a kissing complex
	in which the monomers with a stem/loop conformation are linked by
	intermolecular loop-loop interactions. Two divergent experimental
	structures of the kissing complex from the Lai isolate are reported
	in the literature, one obtained from NMR (Mujeeb et al., Nature Structural
	Biology, 1998, Vol. 5, pp. 432-436) and the other one from x-ray
	crystallography (Ennifar et al., Nature Structural Biology, 2001,
	Vol. 8, pp. 1064-1068). A crystallographic structure of the Mal isolate
	was also reported (Ennifar et al., Nature Structure Biology, 2001,
	Vol. 8, pp. 1064-1068). Concerning the extended duplex, a NMR structure
	is available for Lai (Girard et al., Journal of Biomolecular Structure
	and Dynamics, 1999, Vol. 16, pp. 1145-1157) and a crystallographic
	structure for Mal (Ennifar et al., Structure, 1999, Vol. 7, pp. 1439-1449).
	Using a molecular dynamics technique, all these experimental structures
	have been simulated in solution with explicit water and counterions.
	We show that both extended duplex structures are stable. On the contrary,
	the crystallographic structures of the Lai and Mal kissing complexes
	are rapidly destabilized in aqueous environment. Finally, the NMR
	structure of the Lai loop-loop kissing complex remains globally stable
	over a 20 ns MD simulation, although large rearrangements occur at
	the level of the stem/loop junctions that are flexible, as shown
	from free energy calculations. These results are compared to electrophoresis
	experiments on dimer formation.},

                  human FGF receptor 1 (FGFR 1) gene (flg). We found three 
                  alternative exons encoding a portion of the third

                  secreted form of FGFR 1. The other two encode sequences that 
                  are likely part of transmembrane forms of FGFR 1. One of 
                  these forms has not been previously reported in published 
                  cDNAs. Also, we have determined the structural organization 
                  of a portion of the human FGFR 2 gene (bek) and found a 
                  similar arrangement of alternative exons for the third 
                  Ig-like domain. The arrangement of these genes suggests that

                  secreted FGF receptors as well as the expression of at least 
                  two distinct membrane-spanning forms of the FGF receptors. 
                  The diverse forms appear to be generated by alternative

                  Surveying sequence and structure-based methods for 
                  predicting TFBSs, we conclude that in order to achieve a 
                  sound and specific method applicable on genomic sequences it 
                  is desirable and important to bring these two approaches

	It was further determined that the addition of a loop score combining

	their cognate miRNAs significantly decreased the false positive rates

	In C. elegans, two key genes in the heterochronic pathway, lin-4

	not translated into protein. These stRNAs exert negative post-transcriptional
	regulation by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated
	regions of their target genes. stRNAs are transcribed as longer precursor
	RNAs that are processed by the RNase Dicer/DCR-1 and members of the
	RDE-1/AGO1 family of proteins, which are better known for their roles
	in RNA interference (RNAi). However, stRNA function appears unrelated
	to RNAi. Both sequence and temporal regulation of let-7 stRNA is
	conserved in other animal species suggesting that this is an evolutionarily
	ancient gene. Indeed, C. elegans, Drosophila and humans encode at
	least 86 other RNAs with similar structural features to lin-4 and
	let-7. We postulate that other small non-coding RNAs may function
	as stRNAs to control temporal identity during development in C. elegans

                  explored four complementary approaches for
                  extracting gene and protein synonyms from text,
                  namely the unsupervised, partially supervised, and

                  alternatives over an archive of biological journal

                  techniques could be a valuable supplement to

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional
                  RNAs, most prominently the miRNAs have been
                  discovered, strongly suggesting that further types
                  of functional RNAs are still hidden in the recently
                  completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques
                  are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA
                  genes. When sufficiently similar sequences are not
                  available for comparative approaches the only known
                  remedy is to search directly for structural
                  features. RESULTS: We present here efficient
                  algorithms for computing locally stable RNA
                  structures at genome-wide scales. Both the minimum
                  energy structure and the complete matrix of base
                  pairing probabilities can be computed in O(N x L(2))
                  time and O(N + L(2)) memory in terms of the length N
                  of the genome and the size L of the largest
                  secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice,
                  the 100 Mb of the complete genome of Caenorhabditis
                  elegans can be folded within about half a day on a
                  modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is
                  sufficient example for a survey for
                  miRNAs. AVAILABILITY: The software described in this

                  construction of alpha-carbon representations of a protein 
                  fold. We investigated the dependence of the number of 
                  conformations on pairwise distance restraints for the 
                  proteins crambin, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and 
                  ubiquitin. Knowledge of between one and two contacts per 
                  monomer is shown to be sufficient to restrict the number of 
                  candidate structures to approximately 1,000 conformations. 
                  Pairwise RMS deviations of atomic position comparisons 
                  between pairs of these 1,000 structures revealed that these 
                  conformations can be grouped into about 25 families of 
                  structures. These results suggest a new approach to 
                  assessing alternative protein folds given a very limited 
                  number of distance restraints. Such restraints are available 
                  from several experimental techniques such as NMR, NOESY, 
                  energy transfer fluorescence spectroscopy, and crosslinking 
                  experiments. This work focuses on exhaustive enumeration of 
                  protein structures with emphasis on the possible use of 
                  NOESY-determined distance restraints.}

	for integrated biochemical systems is in order. {T}he purpose of
	this series of papers is to assess the utility of an alternative
	power-law formalism by carrying out a detailed comparative analysis
	of a relatively large, representative system--the tricarboxylic acid
	cycle of {D}ictyostelium discoideum. {T}his system was chosen because
	considerable experimental information already has been synthesized
	into a detailed kinetic model of the intact system. {I}n this first
	paper, we set the stage for subsequent analysis within the framework
	of the power-law formalism: we review the underlying theory, emphasizing
	recent developments, formulate the model in terms that are convenient
	for the analysis to follow, and develop the system representation
	in both the {M}ichaelis-{M}enten and power-law forms. {I}n the second

                  model, which assumes that each position in the DNA site 
                  contributes independently to the overall protein-DNA 
                  interaction, has been the primary means to describe 
                  transcription factor binding site motifs. Recent biological 
                  experiments, however, suggest that there exists 
                  interdependence among positions in the binding sites. In 
                  order to exploit this interdependence to aid motif 
                  discovery, we extend the PWM model to include pairs of 
                  correlated positions and design a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
                  algorithm to sample in the model space. We then combine the 
                  model sampling step with the Gibbs sampling framework for de 
                  novo motif discoveries. RESULTS: Testing on experimentally 
                  validated binding sites, we find that about 25% of the 
                  transcription factor binding motifs show significant 
                  within-site position correlations, and 80% of these motif 
                  models can be improved by considering the correlated 
                  positions. Using both simulated data and real promoter 
                  sequences, we show that the new de novo motif-finding 
                  algorithm can infer the true correlated position pairs 
                  accurately and is more precise in finding putative 
                  transcription factor binding sites than the standard Gibbs 
                  sampling algorithms.}

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Noncoding RNA genes produce transcripts that 
                  exert their function without ever producing proteins. 
                  Noncoding RNA gene sequences do not have strong statistical 
                  signals, unlike protein coding genes. A reliable general 
                  purpose computational genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has 
                  been elusive. RESULTS: We describe a comparative sequence 
                  analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural RNA genes. 
                  The key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions 
                  observed in a pairwise alignment of two homologous 
                  sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a pattern 
                  of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved structural 
                  RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations 
                  consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We 
                  formalize this intuition using three probabilistic 
                  "pair-grammars": a pair stochastic context free grammar 
                  modeling alignments constrained by structural RNA evolution, 
                  a pair hidden Markov model modeling alignments constrained 
                  by coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden Markov model 
                  modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent 
                  evolution. Given an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. 
                  from a BLASTN comparison of two related genomes) we classify 
                  the alignment into the coding, RNA, or null class according 
                  to the posterior probability of each class. CONCLUSIONS: We 
                  have implemented this approach as a program, QRNA, which we 
                  consider to be a prototype structural noncoding RNA 
                  genefinder. Tests suggest that this approach detects 
                  noncoding RNA genes with a fair degree of reliability.}

	{O}ne of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward

	{Y}, and both jointly regulate gene {Z}. {O}n the basis of mathematical
	modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward

                  splicing of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) 
                  pre-mRNA is tightly regulated. A sequence termed ISAR 
                  (intronic splicing activator and repressor) has been 
                  implicated as an important cis regulatory element in both

                  minigenes containing a series of 2-bp mutations in the 18 
                  3'-most nucleotides of ISAR that we refer to as the ISAR 
                  core. Transfection of cells with dual-exon (IIIb and IIIc) 
                  minigenes revealed that mutation of terminal sequences of 
                  the core led to decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased

                  decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased exon IIIc 
                  inclusion, respectively. Nucleotides of the ISAR core 
                  responsible for exon IIIb activation appear to overlap very

                  enzyme-catalyzed, reversible post-translational
                  modification that modulates protein function. It was
                  originally discovered as the pathogenic principle of
                  diphtheria-, cholera-, and other potent bacterial
                  toxins. By analogy, corresponding enyzmes were
                  postulated to exist in animal tissues, and mounting
                  biochemical evidence indicates that such enzymes,
                  indeed, play important regulatory roles in cellular
                  functions. The molecular cloning of the first
                  mammalian mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase from rabbit
                  skeletal muscle, the finding of its homology to a
                  well-studied T-cell marker, RT6, and the molecular
                  cloning of additional gene family members from
                  mammals and birds is providing fresh impetus to
                  research in this field. Intriguingly, these
                  vertebrate enzymes are predicted to be secretory or
                  membrane proteins. They are expressed in lymphatic
                  tissues, muscle, testis, bone marrow, and
                  erythroblasts. Here we review the relationship
                  between this novel family of eucaryotic
                  mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases (mADPRTs),

                  cyclases, and the ADP-ribosylprotein hydrolase (ARH)

                  for comparing two long DNA sequences to identify conserved 
                  segments and for producing informative, high-resolution 
                  displays of the resulting alignments. One display is a 
                  percent identity plot (pip), which shows both the position 
                  in one sequence and the degree of similarity for each 
                  aligning segment between the two sequences in a compact and 
                  easily understandable form. Positions along the horizontal 
                  axis can be labeled with features such as exons of genes and 
                  repetitive elements, and colors can be used to clarify and 
                  enhance the display. The web site also provides a plot of 
                  the locations of those segments in both species (similar to 
                  a dot plot). PipMaker is appropriate for comparing genomic 
                  sequences from any two related species, although the types 
                  of information that can be inferred (e.g., protein-coding 
                  regions and cis-regulatory elements) depend on the level of 
                  conservation and the time and divergence rate since the 
                  separation of the species. Gene regulatory elements are 
                  often detectable as similar, noncoding sequences in species 
                  that diverged as much as 100-300 million years ago, such as 
                  humans and mice, Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, or 
                  Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. PipMaker supports 
                  analysis of unfinished or "working draft" sequences by 
                  permitting one of the two sequences to be in unoriented and 
                  unordered contigs.}

                  proteins are essential for AAV DNA replication and

                  identified a cellular protein interacting with Rep78
                  and Rep68 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST
                  pull-down assays. This protein has recently been
                  described as both a p53 (p53BP3) and a topoisomerase
                  I interacting protein (Topors). It contains an
                  arginine/serine-rich domain, a RING finger domain
                  and five PEST sequences. A minimal sequence
                  sufficient for interaction with Rep was mapped to
                  Topors amino acids 871 to 917. We show that the same
                  region is also involved in the interaction with
                  p53. Rep sequences involved in interaction with
                  Topors were mapped to Rep amino acids 172 to
                  481. Overexpression of Topors stimulated AAV gene
                  expression in the absence of helper virus,
                  suggesting a function of Topors as a transcriptional

                  Fas, yet resist apoptosis induction through its ligation. A 
                  proximal step in apoptotic signaling through Fas is 
                  implicated in this resistance, as these cells undergo normal 
                  levels of apoptosis induction after exposure to tumor 
                  necrosis factor-alpha. We studied the Fas receptors 
                  expressed in human thymocytes to search for mechanisms of 
                  receptor-mediated inhibition of Fas signaling in these 
                  cells. We describe here a unique, membrane-bound form of Fas 
                  receptor that contained a complete extracellular domain of 
                  Fas but that lacked a death domain due to alternative 
                  splicing of exon 7. This Fas decoy receptor (FDR) was shown 
                  to have nearly wild-type ability to bind native human Fas 
                  ligand and was expressed predominantly at the plasma 
                  membrane. Unlike soluble forms of Fas receptor, FDR 
                  dominantly inhibited apoptosis induction by Fas ligand in 
                  transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Titration of FDR 
                  in Fas-expressing cells suggests that FDR may operate 
                  through the formation of mixed receptor complexes. FDR also 
                  dominantly inhibited Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T 
                  cells. In mixing experiments with wild-type Fas, FDR was 
                  capable of inhibiting death signaling at molar ratios less 
                  than 0.5, and this relative level of FDR:wild type message 
                  was observed in at least some thymocytes tested. The data

                  be regulated by expression of a membrane-bound decoy

   abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans vulva is an important paradigm for cell-cell interactions in animal development. The fates of six vulval precursor cells are patterned through the action of the epidermal growth factor receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR-MAPK) inductive signaling pathway, which specifies the 1 degrees fate, and the LIN-12/Notch lateral signaling pathway, which specifies the 2 degrees fate. Here, we provide evidence that the inductive signal is spatially graded and initially activates the EGFR-MAPK pathway in the prospective 2 degrees cells. Subsequently, this effect is counteracted by the expression of multiple new negative regulators of the EGFR-MAPK pathway, under direct transcriptional control of the LIN-12-mediated lateral signal.}

abstract = "{RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNAs. In attempts to identify RNAi triggers that effectively function at lower concentrations, we found that synthetic RNA duplexes 25-30 nucleotides in length can be up to 100-fold more potent than corresponding conventional 21-mer small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Some sites that are refractory to silencing by 21-mer siRNAs can be effectively targeted by 27-mer duplexes, with silencing lasting up to 10 d. Notably, the 27-mers do not induce interferon or activate protein kinase R (PKR). The enhanced potency of the longer duplexes is attributed to the fact that they are substrates of the Dicer endonuclease, directly linking the production of siRNAs to incorporation in the RNA-induced silencing complex. These results provide an alternative strategy for eliciting RNAi-mediated target cleavage using low concentrations of synthetic RNA as substrates for cellular Dicer-mediated cleavage.}",

                  important for constitutive RNA splicing, no helicases have 
                  been implicated in alternative RNA splicing. Here, we show 
                  that the abundant DEAD-box RNA helicase p72, but not its 
                  close relative p68, affects the splicing of alternative 
                  exons containing AC-rich exon enhancer elements. The effect 
                  of p72 was tested by using mini-genes that undergo different 
                  types of alternative splicing. When the concentration of p72 
                  was increased in transient transfections, the inclusion of 
                  enhancer-containing CD44 alternative exons v4 and v5 
                  increased using a mini-gene that contained these exons and 
                  their flanking introns inserted into a beta-globin gene. 
                  Other types of alternative splicing were not impacted by 
                  altering p72 concentrations. Mutation of the p72 helicase 
                  ATP-binding site or deletion of the carboxy-terminal region 
                  of the protein reduced the ability of the transfected 
                  protein to affect CD44 variable exon splicing. Use of in 
                  vitro extracts overexpressing p72 indicated that p72 becomes 
                  associated with complexes containing precursor RNA. 
                  Helicases have been implicated both in altering RNA-RNA 
                  interactions and in remodeling RNA-protein complexes. CD44 
                  exon v4 contains a potential internal secondary structure 
                  element that base pairs the 5' splice site with a region 
                  inside the exon located between enhancer elements. Mutations 
                  that destroyed this complementarity modestly increased 
                  inclusion in the absence of p72 but still responded to 
                  increasing p72 concentration like the wild-type exon, 
                  suggesting that p72 might have effects on protein-RNA 
                  interactions. In agreement with this hypothesis, p72 was not 
                  able to restore the inclusion of an exon mutated for its 
                  major enhancer element. Our results suggest that RNA 
                  helicases may be important alternative splicing regulatory 
                  factors.}

                  selectively bind small molecules. In the past two
                  years, it has become clear that nature has already
                  devised its own aptamers that play important
                  regulatory roles. RNA sensors have been discovered
                  in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
                  that function as molecular switches in response to
                  direct binding of structurally diverse
                  metabolites. These natural RNA aptamers, called
                  'riboswitches', are imbedded in the leader sequences
                  of numerous metabolic genes. Riboswitches are able
                  to repress or activate their cognate genes at both
                  transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we
                  summarize the recent progress in the identification
                  and characterization of riboswitches and discuss
                  their evolution and distribution.}

                  involved in gene regulation and expression is a major 
                  challenge in molecular biology. In this paper we describe a 
                  novel algorithm and the software for searching nucleotide 
                  and protein sequences for complex nucleotide patterns 
                  including potential secondary structure elements, also 
                  allowing for mismatches/mispairings below a user-fixed 
                  threshold, and assessing the statistical significance of 
                  their occurrence through a Markov chain simulation. RESULTS: 
                  The application of the proposed algorithm allowed the 
                  identification of some functional elements, such as the Iron 
                  Responsive Element, the Histone stem-loop structure and the

	Its sequence is species specific. It has already been used extensively

	(where historically, the mitochondrial genes have dominated species
	studies). Despite initial impressions that ITS2 is too variable,
	it has proven to provide useful biological information at higher

	aspects of its transcript secondary structure. The review of all
	eukaryote groups reveals that ITS2 is expandable, but always retains
	in its {RNA} transcript a common core structure of two helices with
	hallmark characteristics important for ribosomal {RNA} processing.
	This aspect of its {RNA} transcript secondary structure can rescue
	difficult alignment problems, making the ITS2 a more powerful tool
	for phylogenetics. Equally important, the recognition of eukaryote-wide

The UGA codon context of the Escherichia coli fdhF mRNA includes an
element called the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) that is
responsible for the UGA-directed incorporation of the amino acid
selenocysteine into a protein. Here, we describe an extended fdhF SECIS
that includes the information for an additional function: the prevention
of UGA readthrough under conditions of selenium deficiency. This
information is contained in a short mRNA region consisting of a single C
residue adjacent to the UGA on its downstream side, and an additional
segment consisting of the six nucleotides immediately upstream from it.
These two regions act independently and additively, and probably through
different mechanisms. The single C residue acts as itself; the upstream
region acts at the level of the two amino acids, arginine and valine, for
which it codes. These two codons at the 5' side of the UGA correspond to
the ribosomal E and P sites. Here, we present a model for the E. coli fdhF
SECIS as a multifunctional RNA structure containing three functional
elements. Depending on the availability of selenium, the SECIS enables one
of two alternatives for the translational machinery: either selenocysteine
incorporation into a polypeptide or termination of the polypeptide chain.}

  abstract =	 {Now that the mouse and human genome sequences are complete, 
                  biologists need systematic approaches to determine the 
                  function of each gene. A powerful way to discover gene 
                  function is to determine the consequence of mutations in 
                  living organisms. Large-scale production of mouse mutations 
                  with the point mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is a key 
                  strategy for analysing the human genome because mouse 
                  mutants will reveal functions unique to mammals, and many 
                  may model human diseases. To examine genes conserved between 
                  human and mouse, we performed a recessive ENU mutagenesis 
                  screen that uses a balancer chromosome, inversion chromosome 
                  11 (refs 4, 5). Initially identified in the fruitfly, 
                  balancer chromosomes are valuable genetic tools that allow 
                  the easy isolation of mutations on selected chromosomes. 
                  Here we show the isolation of 230 new recessive mouse 
                  mutations, 88 of which are on chromosome 11. This genetic 
                  strategy efficiently generates and maps mutations on a 
                  single chromosome, even as mutations throughout the genome 
                  are discovered. The mutations reveal new defects in 
                  haematopoiesis, craniofacial and cardiovascular development, 
                  and fertility.}

   abstract = {The relationship between cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and human neutrophil motility was studied by video microscopy. Neutrophils stimulated by a uniform concentration of an N-formylated peptide chemoattractant (f-Met-Leu-Phe) were tracked during chemokinetic migration on albumin, fibronectin, and vitronectin. [Ca2+]i buffering with quin2 resulted in significant decreases in mean speed on albumin. To further characterize the relationship between [Ca2+]i changes and motility we carried out a cross-correlation analysis of [Ca2+]i with several motility parameters. Cross-correlations between [Ca2+]i and each cell's speed, angle changes, turn strength, and persistent forward motion revealed (i) a positive correlation between [Ca2+]i and cell speed (p \&lt; 0.05), (ii) no significant correlation between turns and calcium spikes, and (iii) the occurrence of turns during periods of low speed. Significant negative correlations between [Ca2+]i and angle change were noted on the high adhesion substrates vitronectin and fibronectin but not on the low adhesion substrate albumin. These data imply that there is a general temporal relationship between [Ca2+]i, speed, and persistent motion. However, the correlations are not sufficiently strong to imply that changes in [Ca2+]i are required proximal signals for velocity changes.}

                  proteins. Such a catalogue cannot be constructed by 
                  computational annotation alone; it requires experimental 
                  validation on a genome scale. Using 'exon' and 'tiling' 
                  arrays fabricated by ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesis, we 
                  devised an experimental approach to validate and refine 
                  computational gene predictions and define full-length 
                  transcripts on the basis of co-regulated expression of their

                  identification of the tissue- and disease-specific

                  technique to chromosome 22q under 69 experimental condition 
                  pairs, and to the entire human genome under two experimental

                  consistent and reliable genome annotation, more efficient, 
                  full-length complementary DNA cloning strategies and

a high-affinity binding site for Rev of the HIV-1 Rev responsive element
(RRE), two derivatives of RBE3 (RBE3AA and RBE3-A), and the complex of RBE3
with peptides derived from the RNA binding domain of HIV-1 Rev, are
presented. The high-affinity binding site of the RRE consists of an
asymmetric internal loop and surrounding Watson-Crick base pairs. In the
wild-type RRE, one of the stems is closed by a loop; this is replaced in
REB3 by the stable UUCG tetraloop. NOE data suggest that the internal loop
of the free RNA contains structural features that have been predicted on the
basis of in vitro selection experiments [Bartel, D.P., et al. (1991) Cell
67, 529-536]. The structural features include a Gsyn.Ganti base pair, a
Ganti.Aanti base pair, and a looped out U. When the Rev peptide is bound to
the RNA, the base pairs in the internal loop appear to be stabilized,
although the RNA chemical shifts indicate that the RNA conformation
undergoes some changes when bound by Rev peptide.}

  abstract =	 {Because deleterious alleles arising from mutation are 
                  filtered by natural selection, mutations that create such 
                  alleles will be underrepresented in the set of common 
                  genetic variation existing in a population at any given 
                  time. Here, we describe an approach based on this idea 
                  called VERIFY (variant elimination reinforces 
                  functionality), which can be used to assess the extent of 
                  natural selection acting on an oligonucleotide motif or set 
                  of motifs predicted to have biological activity. As an 
                  application of this approach, we analyzed a set of 238 
                  hexanucleotides previously predicted to have exonic splicing 
                  enhancer (ESE) activity in human exons using the relative 
                  enhancer and silencer classification by unanimous enrichment 
                  (RESCUE)-ESE method. Aligning the single nucleotide 
                  polymorphisms (SNPs) from the public human SNP database to 
                  the chimpanzee genome allowed inference of the direction of 
                  the mutations that created present-day SNPs. Analyzing the 
                  set of SNPs that overlap RESCUE-ESE hexamers, we conclude 
                  that nearly one-fifth of the mutations that disrupt 
                  predicted ESEs have been eliminated by natural selection 
                  (odds ratio = 0.82 +/- 0.05). This selection is strongest 
                  for the predicted ESEs that are located near splice sites. 
                  Our results demonstrate a novel approach for quantifying the 
                  extent of natural selection acting on candidate functional 
                  motifs and also suggest certain features of mutations/SNPs, 
                  such as proximity to the splice site and disruption or 
                  alteration of predicted ESEs, that should be useful in 
                  identifying variants that might cause a biological 
                  phenotype.}

                  secondary structures in the mRNAs of selenoproteins. These 
                  elements differ in sequence, structure, and location in the 
                  mRNA, that is, coding versus 3' untranslated region, in 
                  prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Analyses of eukaryotic 
                  selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements via 
                  computer folding programs, mutagenesis studies, and chemical 
                  and enzymatic probing has led to the derivation of a 
                  predicted consensus structural model for these elements. 
                  This model consists of a stem-loop or hairpin, with 
                  conserved nucleotides in the loop and in a non-Watson-Crick 
                  motif at the base of the stem. However, the sequences of a 
                  number of SECIS elements predict that they would diverge 
                  from the consensus structure in the loop region. Using 
                  site-directed mutagenesis to introduce mutations predicted 
                  to either disrupt or restore structure, or to manipulate 
                  loop size or stem length, we show that eukaryotic SECIS 
                  elements fall into two distinct classes, termed forms 1 and 
                  2. Form 2 elements have additional secondary structures not 
                  present in form 1 elements. By either insertion or deletion 
                  of the sequences and structures distinguishing the two 
                  classes of elements while maintaining appropriate loop size, 
                  conversion of a form 1 element to a functional form 2-like 
                  element and of a form 2 to a functional form 1-like element 
                  was achieved. These results suggest commonality of function 
                  of the two classes. The information obtained regarding the 
                  existence of two classes of SECIS elements and the 
                  tolerances for manipulations of stem length and loop size 
                  should facilitate designing RNA molecules for obtaining 
                  high-resolution structural information about these elements.}

                  secondary structural motif in the 3' untranslated region of 
                  the selenoprotein mRNA. This selenocysteine insertion 
                  sequence (SECIS) element is predicted to form a hairpin and 
                  contains three regions of sequence invariance that are 
                  thought to interact with a specific protein or proteins. 
                  Specificity of RNA-binding protein recognition of cognate 
                  RNAs is usually characterized by the ability of the protein 
                  to recognize and distinguish between a consensus binding 
                  site and sequences containing mutations to highly conserved 
                  positions in the consensus sequence. Using a functional 
                  assay for the ability of wild-type and mutant SECIS elements 
                  to direct cotranslational selenocysteine incorporation, we 
                  have investigated the relative contributions of individual

                  the novel finding that, for this consensus RNA motif, 
                  mutations at the invariant nucleotides are tolerated to 
                  different degrees in different elements, depending on the 
                  identity of a single nonconserved nucleotide. Further, we 
                  demonstrate that the sequences adjacent to the minimal 
                  element, although not required for function, can affect 
                  function through their propensity to base pair. These 
                  findings shed light on the specific structure these 
                  conserved sequences may form within the element. This 
                  information is crucial to the design of strategies for the 
                  identification of SECIS-binding proteins, and hence the 
                  elucidation of the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation

                  B-DNA of the twist angles, base pair roll, sideways shift, 
                  and propeller suppression in 56 promoters at the three 
                  sites. I also appended to these the twist angle computations 
                  on additional 77 promoters from the recently published 
                  compilation of promoter sequences. For the latter, 
                  additional nucleotides from the spacer regions were added. 
                  The results display similarities at the -10 site. Equally 
                  strong similarities were obtained for the -35 and the -16 
                  contact regions. The existence of structural differences for 
                  some sites is likely to account for the different degrees of 
                  efficiency of the polymerase recognition and transcriptional 
                  regulation.}

                  biological problems is to find a Viterbi (maximal weight) 
                  path through the HMM graph. The Viterbi algorithm reduces 
                  the problem of finding the most likely hidden state sequence 
                  that explains given observations, to a dynamic programming 
                  problem for corresponding directed acyclic graphs. For 
                  example, in the gene finding application, the HMM is used to 
                  find the most likely underlying gene structure given a DNA 
                  sequence. In this note we discuss the applications of 
                  sampling methods for HMMs. The standard sampling algorithm 
                  for HMMs is a variant of the common forward-backward and 
                  backtrack algorithms, and has already been applied in the 
                  context of Gibbs sampling methods. Nevetheless, the practice 
                  of sampling state paths from HMMs does not seem to have been 
                  widely adopted, and important applications have been 
                  overlooked. We show how sampling can be used for finding 
                  alternative splicings for genes, including alternative 
                  splicings that are conserved between genes from related 
                  organisms. We also show how sampling from the posterior 
                  distribution is a natural way to compute probabilities for 
                  predicted exons and gene structures being correct under the 
                  assumed model. Finally, we describe a new memory efficient 
                  sampling algorithm for certain classes of HMMs which 
                  provides a practical sampling alternative to the Hirschberg 
                  algorithm for optimal alignment. The ideas presented have 
                  applications not only to gene finding and HMMs but more 
                  generally to stochastic context free grammars and RNA 
                  structure prediction. Key words: suboptimal parses,

                  cells, leading to epithelial hyperstratification of
                  the structures. mRNAs of transcription factors
                  essential for forebrain development such as Emx1/2

                  Islet1+Lim1/2- motoneurons appeared by the addition
                  of Noggin. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth
                  factor (bFGF) promoted enlargement of central lumen
                  and elongation of the structures. mRNAs of caudal
                  markers, Gbx2, Cdx2 and Hoxb4/9 were expressed and
                  Lim1/2+ spinal motoneurons appeared by the addition

                  mild enlargement of central lumen of the

                  induced Slug+ neural crest-like cells surrounding
                  the tube-like structures. mRNAs of Snail and dHand,
                  other markers for neural crest cells, were also
                  expressed by the addition of BMP-4. These results
                  suggest that Noggin lead the neural-tube like
                  structures to forebrain fate, whereas bFGF was

                  rarely during translation, yet some genes have evolved
                  sequences that efficiently induce frameshifting. These
                  sequences, termed programmed frameshift sites,
                  manipulate the translational apparatus to promote
                  non-canonical decoding. Frameshifts are
                  mechanistically diverse. Most cause a -1 shift of
                  frames; the first such site was discovered in a
                  metazoan retrovirus, but they are now known to be
                  dispersed quite widely among evolutionarily diverse
                  species. +1 frameshift sites are much less common, but
                  again dispersed widely. The rarest form are the
                  translational hop sites which program the ribosome to
                  bypass a region of several dozen nucleotides. Each of
                  these types of events are stimulated by distinct
                  mechanisms. All of the events share a common
                  phenomenology in which the programmed frameshift site
                  causes the ribosome to pause during elongation so that
                  the kinetically unfavorable alternative decoding event
                  can occur. During this pause most frameshifts occur
                  because one or more ribosome-bound tRNAs slip between
                  cognate or near-cognate codons. However, even this
                  generalization is not entirely consistent, since some
                  frameshifts occur without slippage. Because of their
                  similarity to rarer translational errors, programmed
                  frameshift sites provide a tool with which to probe
                  the mechanism of frame maintenance.},

  abstract = {The formation of a duplex between two nucleic acid strands is restricted
	if one of the strands forms an intra- or intermolecular secondary
	structure. The formation of the new duplex requires the dissociation
	and replacement of the initial structure. To understand the mechanism
	of this type of kinetics we studied the replacement of a labeled
	DNA oligonucleotide probe bound to a complementary DNA target with
	an unlabeled probe of the same sequence. The replacement kinetics
	were measured using a gel-shift assay for 12, 14 and 16-nucleotide
	probes as a function of temperature and concentration of the unlabeled
	probe. The results demonstrate that the overall replacement rate
	is a combination of two kinetic pathways: dissociative and sequential
	displacement. The dissociative pathway occurs by the spontaneous
	dissociation of the initial duplex followed by association of the
	target and unlabeled probe. The sequential displacement pathway requires
	only the partial melting of the initial duplex to allow for the formation
	of a branched nucleation complex with the unlabeled probe, followed
	by the complete displacement of the labeled probe by migration of
	the branch point. The contribution from the dissociative pathway
	is predominant at temperatures close to the melting point of the
	labeled probe, whereas the contribution from the displacement pathway

                  controls the expression of numerous genes in response to 
                  developmental and extracellular signals. Poly(A) tail 
                  regulation requires cooperative binding of two human U1A 
                  proteins to an RNA regulatory region called the 
                  polyadenylation inhibition element (PIE). When bound to PIE 
                  RNA, U1A proteins also bind to the enzyme responsible for 
                  formation of the mature 3'-end of most eukaryotic mRNAs, 
                  poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The NMR structure of the 38 kDa 
                  complex formed between two U1A molecules and PIE RNA shows 
                  that binding cooperativity depends on helix C located at the 
                  end of the RNA-binding domain and just adjacent to the 
                  PAP-interacting domain of U1A. Since helix C undergoes a 
                  conformational change upon RNA binding, the structure shows 
                  that binding cooperativity and interactions with PAP occur 
                  only when U1A is bound to its cognate RNA. This mechanism 
                  ensures that the activity of PAP enzyme, which is essential 
                  to the cell, is only down regulated when U1A is bound to the 
                  U1A mRNA.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Automatic extraction of motifs that occur 
                  frequently on a set of unaligned DNA sequences is useful for 
                  predicting the binding sites of unknown transcription 
                  factors. Several programs for this purpose have been 
                  released. However, in our opinion, they are not practical 
                  enough to be applied to a large number of upstream 
                  sequences. RESULTS: We propose a new program called YEBIS 
                  (Yet another Environment for the analysis of BIopolymer 
                  Sequences) which is capable of extracting a set of motifs, 
                  without any a priori knowledge, from a number of 
                  functionally related DNA sequences. Using the hidden Markov 
                  model, these motifs are represented in a more general form 
                  than other conventional methods, such as the weight matrix 
                  method. When applied to several sets of benchmark data, it 
                  was found that YEBIS had comparable capability to the 
                  existing methods, but was much faster. Moreover, it could 
                  extract all known motifs from the LTR sequences (long 
                  terminal repeat sequences) in a single run. Finally, it 
                  could be successfully applied to approximately 400 human 
                  promoter sequences and some of the extracted motifs turned 
                  out to be known cis-elements. Therefore, YEBIS could be a 
                  practical tool for exploring the upstream sequences of 
                  genomic ORFs, some of which are regulated in a similar 
                  fashion. AVAILABILITY: YEBIS will be distributed to academic 
                  users free of charge. All requests should be sent to the

                  all suboptimal secondary structures between the
                  minimum free energy and an arbitrary upper
                  limit. The algorithm is particularly fast in the
                  vicinity of the minimum free energy. This enables
                  the efficient approximation of statistical
                  quantities, such as the partition function or
                  measures for structural diversity. The density of
                  states at low energies and its associated structures
                  are crucial in assessing from a thermodynamic point
                  of view how well-defined the ground state is. We
                  demonstrate this by exploring the role of base
                  modification in tRNA secondary structures, both at
                  the level of individual sequences from Escherichia
                  coli and by comparing artificially generated
                  ensembles of modified and unmodified sequences with
                  the same tRNA structure. The two major conclusions
                  are that (1) base modification considerably sharpens
                  the definition of the ground state structure by
                  constraining energetically adjacent structures to be
                  similar to the ground state, and (2) sequences whose
                  ground state structure is thermodynamically well
                  defined show a significant tendency to buffer single
                  point mutations. This can have evolutionary

                  palindromic. Nevertheless, the protein molecule obtained as 
                  a result of reading the sequence backwards, i.e. a 
                  retro-protein, obviously has the same amino acid composition 
                  and the same hydrophobicity profile as the native sequence. 
                  The important questions which arise in the context of 
                  retro-proteins are: does a retro-protein fold to a well 
                  defined native-like structure as natural proteins do and, if 
                  the answer is positive, does a retro-protein fold to a 
                  structure similar to the native conformation of the original 
                  protein? In this work, the fold of retro-protein A, 
                  originated from the retro-sequence of the B domain of 
                  Staphylococcal protein A, was studied. As a result of 
                  lattice model simulations, it is conjectured that the 
                  retro-protein A also forms a three-helix bundle structure in 
                  solution. It is also predicted that the topology of the 
                  retro-protein A three-helix bundle is that of the native 
                  protein A, rather than that corresponding to the mirror 
                  image of native protein A. Secondary structure elements in 
                  the retro-protein do not exactly match their counterparts in 
                  the original protein structure; however, the amino acid side 
                  chain contract pattern of the hydrophobic core is partly 
                  conserved.}

Even when the involved physicochemical signals are unknown, the cellular system can be treated phenomenologically like an automatic controller having a closed-loop feedback system. The model is verified by means of galvanotaxis and chemotaxis data of human granulocytes. The galvanotaxis and chemotaxis coefficient quantifying the cellular sensibility can be predicted from the coefficient which characterizes the deterministic part of the signal transduction/response system of the cell divided by the coefficient which characterizes the noise strength in the cellular signal transduction/response system. The model is not restricted to directed movement of granulocytes. It is very general and can be applied to any cell type for directed phenomena like chemotaxis, galvanotaxis, phototaxis, magnetotaxis, directed growth, etc. The virus-disturbed directed migration of granulocytes is discussed and it is shown that the virus alters the deterministic part of the cellular controller.}

	containing a set of immobilized oligonucleotides is being developed.
	A theoretical analysis is presented of the kinetics of {DNA} hybridization
	with deoxynucleotide molecules chemically tethered in a polyacrylamide
	gel layer. The analysis has shown that long-term evolution of the
	spatial distribution and of the amount of {DNA} bound in a hybridization
	cell is governed by "retarded diffusion," i.e., diffusion of the
	DNA interrupted by repeated association and dissociation with immobile
	oligonucleotide molecules. Retarded diffusion determines the characteristic
	time of establishing a final equilibrium state in a cell, i.e., the
	state with the maximum quantity and a uniform distribution of bound
	DNA. In the case of cells with the most stable, perfect duplexes,
	the characteristic time of retarded diffusion (which is proportional
	to the equilibrium binding constant and to the concentration of binding
	sites) can be longer than the duration of the real hybridization
	procedure. This conclusion is indirectly confirmed by the observation
	of nonuniform fluorescence of labeled {DNA} in perfect-match hybridization
	cells (brighter at the edges). For optimal discrimination of perfect
	duplexes from duplexes with mismatches the hybridization process
	should be brought to equilibrium under low-temperature nonsaturation
	conditions for all cells. The kinetic differences between perfect
	and nonperfect duplexes in the gel allow further improvement in the
	discrimination through additional washing at low temperature after
	hybridization.},

  abstract =	 {Transcription factor binding sites are short fragments in 
                  the upstream regions of genes, to which transcription 
                  factors bind to regulate the transcription of genes into 
                  mRNA. Computational identification of transcription factor 
                  binding sites remains an unsolved challenging problem though 
                  a great amount of effort has been put into the study of this 
                  problem. We have recently developed a novel technique for 
                  identification of binding sites from a set of upstream 
                  regions of genes, that could possibly be transcriptionally 
                  co-regulated and hence might share similar transcription 
                  factor binding sites. By utilizing two key features of such 
                  binding sites (i.e. their high sequence similarities and 
                  their relatively high frequencies compared to other sequence 
                  fragments), we have formulated this problem as a cluster 
                  identification problem. That is to identify and extract data 
                  clusters from a noisy background. While the classical data 
                  clustering problem (partitioning a data set into clusters 
                  sharing common or similar features) has been extensively 
                  studied, there is no general algorithm for solving the 
                  problem of identifying data clusters from a noisy 
                  background. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for 
                  solving such a problem. We have proved that a cluster 
                  identification problem, under our definition, can be 
                  rigorously and efficiently solved through searching for 
                  substrings with special properties in a linear sequence. We 
                  have also developed a method for assessing the statistical 
                  significance of each identified cluster, which can be used 
                  to rule out accidental data clusters. We have implemented 
                  the cluster identification algorithm and the statistical 
                  significance analysis method as a computer software CUBIC. 
                  Extensive testing on CUBIC has been carried out. We present 
                  here a few applications of CUBIC on challenging cases of 
                  binding site identification.}

MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in sets of protein or DNA sequences.
This paper describes several extensions to MEME which increase its ability
to find motifs in a totally unsupervised fashion, but which also allow it
to benefit when prior knowledge is available. When no background knowledge
is asserted. MEME obtains increased robustness from a method for
determining motif widths automatically, and from probabilistic models that
allow motifs to be absent in some input sequences. On the other hand, MEME
can exploit prior knowledge about a motif being present in all input
sequences, about the length of a motif and whether it is a palindrome, and
(using Dirichlet mixtures) about expected patterns in individual motif
positions. Extensive experiments are reported which support the claim that
MEME benefits from, but does not require, background knowledge. The
experiments use seven previously studied DNA and protein sequence families
and 75 of the protein families documented in the Prosite database of sites
and patterns, Release 11.1.}

  abstract =	 {Motivation: The identification of regulatory control
                  regions within genomes is a major challenge. Studies
                  have demonstrated that regulating regions can be
                  described as locally dense clusters or modules of
                  cis-acting transcription factor binding sites
                  (TFBS). For well-described biological contexts, it
                  is possible to train predictive algorithms to
                  discern novel modules in genome sequences. However,
                  utility of module detection methods has been
                  severely limited by insufficient training data. For
                  only a few tissues can one obtain sufficient numbers
                  of literature-derived regulatory modules. Results:
                  We present a novel method, MSCAN, that circumvents
                  the training data problem by measuring the
                  statistical significance of any non-overlapping
                  combination of TFBS in a window. Given a set of
                  transcription factor binding profiles, a
                  significance threshold, and a genomic sequence,
                  MSCAN returns putative regulatory regions. We assess
                  performance on two curated collections of regulatory
                  regions; one each for tissue-specific expression in
                  liver and skeletal muscle cells. The efficiency of
                  MSCAN allows for predictive screens of entire
                  genomes. Availability:

  abstract =	 {We have examined the alternative splicing of the Drosophila 
                  melanogaster prospero twintron, which contains splice sites 
                  for both the U2- and U12-type spliceosome and generates two 
                  forms of mRNA, pros-L (U2-type product) and pros-S (U12-type 
                  product). We find that twintron splicing is developmentally 
                  regulated: pros-L is abundant in early embryogenesis while 
                  pros-S displays the opposite pattern. We have established a 
                  Kc cell in vitro splicing system that accurately splices a 
                  minimal pros substrate containing the twintron and have 
                  examined the sequence requirements for pros twintron 
                  splicing. Systematic deletion and mutation analysis of 
                  intron sequences established that twintron splicing requires 
                  a 46-nucleotide purine-rich element located 32 nucleotides 
                  downstream of the U2-type 5' splice site. While this element 
                  regulates both splicing pathways, its alteration showed the 
                  severest effects on the U2-type splicing pathway. Addition 
                  of an RNA competitor containing the wild-type purine-rich 
                  element to the Kc extract abolished U2-type splicing and 
                  slightly repressed U12-type splicing, suggesting that a 
                  trans-acting factor(s) binds the enhancer element to 
                  stimulate twintron splicing. Thus, we have identified an 
                  intron region critical for prospero twintron splicing as a 
                  first step towards elucidating the molecular mechanism of 
                  splicing regulation involving competition between the two 
                  kinds of spliceosomes.}

	a large number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets
	are known. In contrast to plant miRNAs, which usually bind nearly
	perfectly to their targets, animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with
	a few nucleotides being unbound, thus producing more complex secondary
	structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we present a program,
	RNA-hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of miRNAs
	in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the energetically
	most favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA.
	Intramolecular hybridizations, that is, base pairings between target
	nucleotides or between miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large
	targets, the time complexity of the algorithm is linear in the target
	length, allowing many long targets to be searched in a short time.
	Statistical significance of predicted targets is assessed with an
	extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free energies,
	a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation
	of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies
	of multiple organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of

                  protein chains. One of us (E.I.S.) selected 10
                  compact conformations of 48-mer chains on the
                  three-dimensional cubic lattice and used their
                  inverse folding algorithm to design HP (H,
                  hydrophobic; P, polar) sequences that should fold to
                  those "target" structures. The sequences, but not
                  the structures, were sent to the UCSF group (K.Y.,
                  K.M.F., P.D.T., H.S.C., and K.A.D.), who used two
                  methods to attempt to find the globally optimal
                  conformations: "hydrophobic zippers" and a
                  constraint-based hydrophobic core construction
                  (CHCC) method. The CHCC method found global minima
                  in all cases, and the hydrophobic zippers method
                  found global minima in some cases, in minutes to
                  hours on workstations. In 9 out of 10 sequences, the
                  CHCC method found lower energy conformations than
                  the 48-mers were designed to fold to. Thus the
                  search strategies succeed for the HP model but the
                  design strategy does not. For every sequence the
                  global energy minimum was found to have multiple
                  degeneracy with 10(3) to 10(6) conformations. We
                  discuss the implications of these results for (i)
                  searching conformational spaces of simple models of
                  proteins and (ii) how these simple models relate to

abstract = {The function of a non-protein-coding RNA is often determined by its structure. Since experimental determination of RNA structure is time-consuming and expensive, its computational prediction is of great interest, and efficient solutions based on thermodynamic parameters are known. Frequently, however, the predicted minimum free energy structures are not the native ones, leading to the necessity of generating suboptimal solutions. While this can be accomplished by a number of programs, the user is often confronted with large outputs of similar structures, although he or she is interested in structures with more fundamental differences, or, in other words, with different abstract shapes. Here, we formalize the concept of abstract shapes and introduce their efficient computation. Each shape of an RNA molecule comprises a class of similar structures and has a representative structure of minimal free energy within the class. Shape analysis is implemented in the program RNAshapes. We applied RNAshapes to the prediction of optimal and suboptimal abstract shapes of several RNAs. For a given energy range, the number of shapes is considerably smaller than the number of structures, and in all cases, the native structures were among the top shape representatives. This demonstrates that the researcher can quickly focus on the structures of interest, without processing up to thousands of near-optimal solutions. We complement this study with a large-scale analysis of the growth behaviour of structure and shape spaces. RNAshapes is available for download and as an online version on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server.},

                  protein interaction data. Our approach is based on
                  the assumption that many pathways exhibit two
                  properties: their genes exhibit a similar gene
                  expression profile, and the protein products of the
                  genes often interact. Our approach is based on a
                  unified probabilistic model, which is learned from
                  the data using the EM algorithm. We present results
                  on two Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data
                  sets, combined with a binary protein interaction
                  data set. Our results show that our approach is much
                  more successful than other approaches at discovering
                  both coherent functional groups and entire protein
                  complexes. Contact: eran

  abstract =	 {We define a \&quot;threaded blockset,\&quot; which
                  is a novel generalization of the classic notion of a
                  multiple alignment. A new computer program called
                  TBA (for \&quot;threaded blockset aligner\&quot;)
                  builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that
                  all matching segments occur in the same order and
                  orientation in the given sequences; inversions and
                  duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to
                  be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means
                  all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian
                  genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any
                  genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that
                  different projections present consistent predictions
                  of which genomic positions are orthologous. This
                  capability is illustrated using a new visualization
                  tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate
                  Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish
                  perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment
                  quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary
                  change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is
                  more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the
                  dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a
                  stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used
                  to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced
                  genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce
                  the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa
                  Cruz Genome Browser.}

                  structure assignments, and additional distance
                  constraints. A cost function taking such constraints
                  into account was used to obtain protein structures
                  using a simple minimization algorithm. For small
                  proteins, the approximate structure could be
                  obtained using one additional distance constraint
                  for each amino acid in the protein. We also studied
                  the effect of using predicted secondary structure
                  and surface assignments. The constraints used in
                  this approach typically may be obtained from
                  low-resolution experimental data. When using a cost
                  function based on distances, half of the resulting

  abstract =	 {The Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion 
                  molecule (Dscam) gene encodes an axon guidance receptor that 
                  can express 38,016 different mRNAs by virtue of alternative 
                  splicing. The Dscam gene contains 95 alternative exons that 
                  are organized into four clusters of 12, 48, 33, and 2 exons 
                  each. Although numerous Dscam mRNA isoforms can be 
                  synthesized, it remains to be determined whether different 
                  Dscam isoforms are synthesized at different times in 
                  development or in different tissues. We have investigated 
                  the alternative splicing of the Dscam exon 4 cluster, which 
                  contains 12 mutually exclusive alternative exons, and found 
                  that Dscam exon 4 alternative splicing is developmentally 
                  regulated. The most highly regulated exon, 4.2, is 
                  infrequently used in early embryos but is the predominant 
                  exon 4 variant used in adults. Moreover, the developmental 
                  regulation of exon 4.2 alternative splicing is conserved in 
                  D. yakuba. In addition, different adult tissues express 
                  distinct collections of Dscam mRNA isoforms. Given the role 
                  of Dscam in neural development, these results suggest that 
                  the regulation of alternative splicing plays an important 
                  role in determining the specificity of neuronal wiring. In 
                  addition, this work provides a framework to determine the 
                  mechanisms by which complex alternative splicing events are 
                  regulated.}

abstract = "{We previously described the existence of abundant, processed, polyadenylated murine Hoxa 11 antisense transcripts. Of particular interest, in the developing limbs the antisense transcripts were observed to be present in a pattern complementary to that of the sense transcripts, suggesting a possible regulatory function (Hsieh-Li et al. 1995). We have analyzed the human HOXA 11 genomic locus, showing strong evolutionary conservation of regions potentially encoding antisense transcripts. Human HOXA 11 fetal kidney antisense cDNAs were identified and sequenced, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of Hoxa 11 antisense transcription. As for the mouse, the human antisense RNAs were polyadenylated and showed several alternative processing patterns, but shared the sequences of a common 3' exon. The evolutionary conservation of the opposite strand transcripts strongly suggests function. A significantly long open reading frame was observed, but mouse-human comparisons argued against true coding function. Murine kidney Hoxa 11 antisense transcription and processing was also examined, revealing tissue-specific differences between limb and kidney. A novel procedure, designated Race in Circles, was devised and used to define mouse limb antisense transcription start sites. Furthermore, comparisons of human, mouse, and chicken sense transcript Hoxa 11 homeobox nucleotide sequences and their respective encoded homeodomains indicate a very strong selective pressure in vertebrates against mutations that result in coding changes. Given the significant differences in amino acid sequences of the homeodomains of different Hox genes, this observation argues for individual homeodomain functional specificity.}",

  abstract = {The RNA folding map, understood as the relationship
  between sequences and s econdary structures or shapes, exhibits
  robust statistical properties summarized by three notions: (1) the
  notion of a typical shape (that among all sequences of fixed length
  certain shapes are realized much more frequently than others), (2)
  the notion of shape space covering (that all typical shapes are
  realized in a small neighborho od of any random sequence), and (3)
  the notion of a neutral network (that sequences folding into the
  same typical shape form networks that percolate through sequence sp
  ace).

  The concept of a neutral network is particularly
  illuminating. Neutral networks loos en the requirements on the
  mutation rate for selection to remain effective. What nee ds to be
  preserved in a population is not a particular sequence, but rather a
  shape.  This mandates a reformulation of the original (genotypic)
  error threshold in terms of a phenotypic error threshold confirming
  the intuition that more errors can be tol erated at higher degrees
  of neutrality.

  With regard to adaptation, neutrality has two seemingly
  contradictory effects: It ac ts as a buffer against mutations
  ensuring that a phenotype is preserved. Yet it is d eeply enabling,
  because it permits evolutionary change to occur by allowing the sequ
  ence context to vary silently until a single point mutation can
  become phenotypicall y consequential. Neutrality also influences
  predictability of adaptive trajectories in seemingly contradictory
  ways. On the one hand it increases the uncertainty of the ir
  genotypic trace. At the same time neutrality structures the access
  from one shape to another, thereby inducing a topology among RNA
  shapes which permits a distinctio n between continuous and
  discontinuous shape transformations. To the extent that ada ptive
  trajectories must undergo such transformations, their phenotypic
  trace becomes more predictable.}

	such as soils. In order to get access to this microbial "black-box,"
	the development of powerful tools such as microarrays are necessary.
	However, the reliability of this approach relies on probe efficiency,
	in particular sensitivity, specificity and explorative power, in
	order to obtain an image of the microbial communities that is close
	to reality. RESULTS: We propose a new probe design algorithm that
	is able to select microarray probes targeting SSU r{RNA} at any phylogenetic
	level. This original approach, implemented in a program called "PhylArray",
	designs a combination of degenerate and non-degenerate probes for
	each target taxon. Comparative experimental evaluations indicate
	that probes designed with PhylArray yield a higher sensitivity and
	specificity than those designed by conventional approaches. Applying
	the combined PhyArray/GoArrays strategy helps to optimize the hybridization
	performance of short probes. Finally, hybridizations with environmental
	targets have shown that the use of the PhylArray strategy can draw
	attention to even previously unknown bacteria. AVAILABILITY: http://fc.isima.fr/~rimour/phylarray/

  abstract =	 {Protein domains represent the basic evolutionary units that 
                  form proteins. Domain duplication and shuffling by 
                  recombination are probably the most important forces driving 
                  protein evolution and hence the complexity of the proteome. 
                  While the duplication of whole genes as well as 
                  domain-encoding exons increases the abundance of domains in 
                  the proteome, domain shuffling increases versatility, i.e. 
                  the number of distinct contexts in which a domain can occur. 
                  Here, we describe a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of 
                  the relationship between these two processes. We observe a 
                  strong and robust correlation between domain versatility and 
                  abundance: domains that occur more often also have many 
                  different combination partners. This supports the view that 
                  domain recombination occurs in a random way. However, we do 
                  not observe all the different combinations that are expected 
                  from a simple random recombination scenario, and this is due 
                  to frequent duplication of specific domain combinations. 
                  When we simulate the evolution of the protein repertoire 
                  considering stochastic recombination of domains followed by 
                  extensive duplication of the combinations, we approximate 
                  the observed data well. Our analyses are consistent with a 
                  stochastic process that governs domain recombination and 
                  thus protein divergence with respect to domains within a 
                  polypeptide chain. At the same time, they support a scenario 
                  in which domain combinations are formed only once during the 
                  evolution of the protein repertoire, and are then duplicated 
                  to various extents. The extent of duplication of different 
                  combinations varies widely and, in nature, will depend on 
                  selection for the domain combination based on its function. 
                  Some of the pair-wise domain combinations that are highly 
                  duplicated also recur frequently with other partner domains, 
                  and thus represent evolutionary units larger than single 
                  protein domains, which we term "supra-domains".}

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {173},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have a multitude of roles in
	the cell, many of which remain to be discovered. However, it is difficult
	to detect novel ncRNAs in biochemical screens. To advance biological
	knowledge, computational methods that can accurately detect ncRNAs
	in sequenced genomes are therefore desirable. The increasing number
	of genomic sequences provides a rich dataset for computational comparative
	sequence analysis and detection of novel ncRNAs. RESULTS: Here, Dynalign,
	a program for predicting secondary structures common to two RNA sequences
	on the basis of minimizing folding free energy change, is utilized
	as a computational ncRNA detection tool. The Dynalign-computed optimal
	total free energy change, which scores the structural alignment and
	the free energy change of folding into a common structure for two
	RNA sequences, is shown to be an effective measure for distinguishing
	ncRNA from randomized sequences. To make the classification as a
	ncRNA, the total free energy change of an input sequence pair can
	either be compared with the total free energy changes of a set of
	control sequence pairs, or be used in combination with sequence length
	and nucleotide frequencies as input to a classification support vector
	machine. The latter method is much faster, but slightly less sensitive
	at a given specificity. Additionally, the classification support
	vector machine method is shown to be sensitive and specific on genomic
	ncRNA screens of two different Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi
	genome alignments, in which many ncRNAs are known. The Dynalign computational
	experiments are also compared with two other ncRNA detection programs,
	RNAz and QRNA. CONCLUSION: The Dynalign-based support vector machine
	method is more sensitive for known ncRNAs in the test genomic screens
	than RNAz and QRNA. Additionally, both Dynalign-based methods are
	more sensitive than RNAz and QRNA at low sequence pair identities.
	Dynalign can be used as a comparable or more accurate tool than RNAz
	or QRNA in genomic screens, especially for low-identity regions.
	Dynalign provides a method for discovering ncRNAs in sequenced genomes
	that other methods may not identify. Significant improvements in
	Dynalign runtime have also been achieved.},

positions 121 and 236 in Escherichia coli RNase P RNA (M1 RNA) has been
demonstrated in eubacterial RNase P RNAs. To investigate whether the
nucleotides at these positions interact in M1 RNA we introduced base
substitutions at either or at both of these positions. Single base
substitutions at 121 or at 236 resulted in M1 RNA molecules which did not
complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype associated with rnpA49 in
vivo whereas wild-type M1 RNA or the double mutant M1 RNA, with restored
base-pairing between 121 and 236, did. In addition, wild-type and the double
mutant M1 RNA were efficiently cleaved by Pb++ between positions 122 and 123
whereas the rate of this cleavage was significantly reduced for the singly
mutated M1 RNA variants. From these data we conclude that the nucleotides at
positions 121 and 236 in M1 RNA establish a novel long-range tertiary
interaction in M1 RNA. Our results also demonstrated that this interaction
is not absolutely required for cleavage in vitro, however, a disruption
resulted in a reduction in cleavage efficiency (kcat/Km), both in the
absence and presence of C5.}

  abstract =	 {Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized inside the nucleus in 
                  such a way that only a subset of the genome is expressed in 
                  any given cell type, but the details of this organization 
                  are largely unknown. SATB1 ('special AT-rich sequence 
                  binding 1'), a protein found predominantly in thymocytes, 
                  regulates genes by folding chromatin into loop domains, 
                  tethering specialized DNA elements to an SATB1 network 
                  structure. Ablation of SATB1 by gene targeting results in 
                  temporal and spatial mis-expression of numerous genes and 
                  arrested T-cell development, suggesting that SATB1 is a 
                  cell-type specific global gene regulator. Here we show that 
                  SATB1 targets chromatin remodelling to the IL-2Ralpha 
                  ('interleukin-2 receptor alpha') gene, which is ectopically 
                  transcribed in SATB1 null thymocytes. SATB1 recruits the 
                  histone deacetylase contained in the NURD chromatin 
                  remodelling complex to a SATB1-bound site in the IL-2Ralpha 
                  locus, and mediates the specific deacetylation of histones 
                  in a large domain within the locus. SATB1 also targets ACF1 
                  and ISWI, subunits of CHRAC and ACF nucleosome mobilizing 
                  complexes, to this specific site and regulates nucleosome 
                  positioning over seven kilobases. SATB1 defines a class of 
                  transcriptional regulators that function as a 'landing 
                  platform' for several chromatin remodelling enzymes and 
                  hence regulate large chromatin domains.}

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: An important step in unravelling the 
                  transcriptional regulatory network of an organism is to 
                  identify, for each transcription factor, all of its DNA 
                  binding sites. Several approaches are commonly used in 
                  searching for a transcription factor's binding sites, 
                  including consensus sequences and position-specific scoring 
                  matrices (PSSMs). Additionally, methods that compute the 
                  average number of nucleotide matches between a putative site 
                  and all known sites can be employed. Such basic approaches 
                  can all be naturally extended by incorporating pairwise 
                  nucleotide dependencies and per-position information 
                  content. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of 
                  these basic approaches and their extensions in finding 
                  binding sites for a transcription factor of interest without 
                  erroneously identifying other genomic sequences. RESULTS: In 
                  cross-validation testing on a data set of E. coli 
                  transcription factors and their binding sites, we show that 
                  there are statistically significant differences in how well 
                  various methods identify transcription factor binding sites. 
                  The use of per-position information content improves the 
                  performance of all basic approaches. Furthermore, including 
                  local pairwise nucleotide dependencies within binding site 
                  models results in statistically significant performance 
                  improvements for approaches based on nucleotide matches. 
                  Based on our analysis, the best results when searching for 
                  DNA binding sites of a particular transcription factor are 
                  obtained by methods that incorporate both information 
                  content and local pairwise correlations. AVAILABILITY: The

                  artificial hairpins on pre-mRNA splicing in protoplasts of a 
                  dicot plant, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Hairpins with a 
                  potential to form 18 or 24 bp stems strongly inhibit 
                  splicing when they sequester the 5' splice site or are 
                  placed in the middle of short introns. However, similar 24 
                  bp hairpins sequestering the 3' splice site do not prevent 
                  this site from being used as an acceptor. Utilization of the 
                  stem-located 3' site requires that the base of the stem is 
                  separated from the upstream 5' splice site by a minimum of 
                  approximately 45 nucleotides and that another 'helper' 3' 
                  splice site is present downstream of the stem. The results

                  may have a potential to unfold secondary structure present 
                  in the downstream portion of the intron, prior to or at the 
                  step of the 3' splice site selection. The finding that the 
                  helper 3' site is required for utilization of the 
                  stem-located acceptor confirms and extends previous 
                  observations, obtained with HeLa cell in vitro splicing 
                  systems, indicating that the 3' splice site may be 
                  recognized at least twice during spliceosome assembly.}

computer-annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL consists of entries in
SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding
sequences (CDSs) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, except the CDSs
already included in SWISS-PROT. We also describe the Human Proteomics

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The Jing-Mai (variously translated as the
		  Channel, Vessel or Meridians), as described by traditional
		  Chinese medicine, probably exists and has represented the
		  connections between various parts of human body during
		  embryonic development. According to the Chinese theories,
		  there are 14 major Jing-Mai within the human body, of which
		  four are directly connected with the Heart. METHODS: The
		  described paths of the four Jing-Mai were compared with
		  features of congenital syndromes involving particular types
		  of congenital heart defects. RESULTS: Specific correlation
		  seem to exist between such four Jing-Mai and known
		  developmental mechanisms underlying various congenital
		  heart defects: the Kidney Jing-Mai-ectomesenchymal tissue
		  migration abnormalities; the Spleen Jing-Mai-situs and
		  looping defects; the Heart Jing-Mai-abnormal cell death;
		  the Small Intestine Jing-Mai (and the Heart
		  Jing-Mai)-extracellular matrix anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: The
		  Chinese theories seem to provide some intriguing insights
		  into the pathogeneses of congenital heart defects. The
		  Jing-Mai seems to distinguish from, but nevertheless have a
		  close relationship with the blood vessels. Utilization of
		  the Jing-Mai will probably enable a better understanding
		  and development of new treatments for cardiovascular

                  efficient functional characterisation of
                  hypothetical proteins. Here, our goal is to map
                  specific sequence patterns to putative functional
                  classes. The evolutionary signal stands out most
                  clearly in a maximally diverse set of
                  homologues. This diversity, however, leads to a
                  number of technical difficulties. The targeted
                  patterns--as gleaned from structure comparisons--are
                  too sparse for statistically significant signals of
                  sequence similarity and accurate multiple sequence
                  alignment. Results: We address this problem by a
                  fuzzy alignment model, which probabilistically
                  assigns residues to structurally equivalent
                  positions (attributes) of the proteins. We then
                  apply multivariate analysis to the `attributes x
                  proteins' matrix. The dimensionality of the space is
                  reduced using non-negative matrix factorization. The
                  method is general, fully automatic and works without
                  assumptions about pattern density, minimum support,
                  explicit multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees,
                  etc. We demonstrate the discovery of biologically
                  meaningful patterns in an extremely diverse
                  superfamily related to urease. Contact:

  volume = {80},
  pages = {5747--5756},

  abstract = {In plants, RNA silencing (RNA interference) is an efficient antiviral
	system, and therefore successful virus infection requires suppression
	of silencing. Although many viral silencing suppressors have been
	identified, the molecular basis of silencing suppression is poorly
	understood. It is proposed that various suppressors inhibit RNA silencing
	by targeting different steps. However, as double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)
	play key roles in silencing, it was speculated that dsRNA binding
	might be a general silencing suppression strategy. Indeed, it was
	shown that the related aureusvirus P14 and tombusvirus P19 suppressors
	are dsRNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, P14 is a size-independent
	dsRNA-binding protein, while P19 binds only 21-nucleotide ds-sRNAs
	(small dsRNAs having 2-nucleotide 3' overhangs), the specificity
	determinant of the silencing system. Much evidence supports the idea
	that P19 inhibits silencing by sequestering silencing-generated viral
	ds-sRNAs. In this study we wanted to test the hypothesis that dsRNA
	binding is a general silencing suppression strategy. Here we show
	that many plant viral silencing suppressors bind dsRNAs. Beet yellows
	virus Peanut P21, clump virus P15, Barley stripe mosaic virus gammaB,
	and Tobacco etch virus HC-Pro, like P19, bind ds-sRNAs size-selectively,
	while Turnip crinkle virus CP is a size-independent dsRNA-binding
	protein, which binds long dsRNAs as well as ds-sRNAs. We propose
	that size-selective ds-sRNA-binding suppressors inhibit silencing
	by sequestering viral ds-sRNAs, whereas size-independent dsRNA-binding
	suppressors inactivate silencing by sequestering long dsRNA precursors
	of viral sRNAs and/or by binding ds-sRNAs. The findings that many
	unrelated silencing suppressors bind dsRNA suggest that dsRNA binding
	is a general silencing suppression strategy which has evolved independently
	many times.},

                  significant fluctuations across eukaryotic genes. In this 
                  paper, we investigate nucleotide variation across an 
                  averaged representation of all known human genes. Such a 
                  representation allows us to average out random fluctuations 
                  that constitute noise and uncover remarkable systematic 
                  trends in nucleotide distributions, particularly near 
                  boundaries between genetic elements--the promoter, exons, 
                  and introns. We propose that such variations result from 
                  differential mutational pressures and from the presence of 
                  specific regulatory motifs, such as transcription and 
                  splicing factor binding sites. Specifically, we observe 
                  significant GC and TA biases (excess of G over C and T over 
                  A) in noncoding regions of genes. Such biases are most 
                  probably caused by transcription-coupled mismatch repair, an 
                  effect that has recently been detected in mammalian genes. 
                  Subsequently, we examine the distribution of all 
                  hexanucleotides and identify motifs that are overrepresented 
                  within regulatory regions. By clustering and aligning such 
                  sequences, we recognize families of putative regulatory 
                  elements involved in exonic and intronic splicing control, 
                  and 3' mRNA processing. Some of our motifs have been 
                  identified in prior theoretical and experimental studies, 
                  thus validating our approach, but we detect several novel 
                  sequences that we propose as candidates for future 
                  functional assays and mutation screens for genetic 
                  disorders.}

	The extent of RNA knockdown was measured for 22 genes by quantitative

	knockdown showed that (i) duplexes targeting the middle of the coding
	sequence silenced significantly poorer, (ii) silencing by duplexes

	sequence, (iii) pooling of four or five duplexes per gene was remarkably
	efficient in knocking down gene expression and (iv) among duplexes
	that achieved a >70% knockdown of the mRNA there were strong nucleotide
	preferences at specific positions, most notably positions 11 (G or
	C) and 19 (T) of the siRNA duplex. Finally, in a proof-of-principle

	which have appeared up to now in the biological literature. Its power
	is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: It is currently believed that the human genome contains about twice as much non-coding functional regions as it does protein-coding genes, yet our understanding of these regions is very limited. RESULTS: We examine the intersection between syntenically conserved sequences in the human, mouse and rat genomes, and sequence similarities within the human genome itself, in search of families of non-protein-coding elements. For this purpose we develop a graph theoretic clustering algorithm, akin to the highly successful methods used in elucidating protein sequence family relationships. The algorithm is applied to a highly filtered set of about 700 000 human-rodent evolutionarily conserved regions, not resembling any known coding sequence, which encompasses 3.7\% of the human genome. From these, we obtain roughly 12 000 non-singleton clusters, dense in significant sequence similarities. Further analysis of genomic location, evidence of transcription and RNA secondary structure reveals many clusters to be significantly homogeneous in one or more characteristics. This subset of the highly conserved non-protein-coding elements in the human genome thus contains rich family-like structures, which merit in-depth analysis.

  abstract =	 {For eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs, it has been proposed 
                  that the SECIS element in the 3'-UTR is required for 
                  recognition of UGA as a Sec codon. Some proteins which bind 
                  to SECIS (SBP) have been reported. However, it is not clear 
                  how the SECIS element in the 3'-UTR can mediate Sec 
                  insertion far at the in-frame UGA Sec codons. The idea that 
                  there must be a signal near the UGA Sec codon is still being 
                  considered. Therefore, we searched for a protein which binds 
                  to an RNA sequence surrounding the UGA Sec codon on human 
                  GPx mRNA. We found a protein, prepared from bovine brain 
                  microsomes, which strongly bound to the RNA fragment 
                  upstream of the UGA Sec codon but not to the RNA sequence 
                  downstream of the UGA codon. This protein also bound to the 
                  SECIS sequence in the 3'-UTR of human GPx, and this binding 
                  to SECIS was competed with the RNA fragment upstream of the 
                  UGA Sec codon. We also obtained the similar results with the 
                  RNA fragments of type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'DI) 
                  mRNAs. Comparison of such RNA fragments with SECIS fragments 
                  revealed similarities in the region upstream of the in-frame 
                  UGA Sec codon of several Se-protein mRNAs. The study thus 
                  favors a novel model of Sec incorporation at the UGA Sec 
                  codon that involves the regions upstream of the UGA codon of 
                  mRNAs of mammalian selenoproteins. This model explains that 
                  the stem-loop structure covering the UGA codon is recognized 
                  by SBP and how the UGA Sec codon escapes from attack by eRF.}

                  complete ensemble of genes is a main goal of
                  deciphering the digital information stored in the
                  human genome. Many algorithms for computational gene
                  prediction have been described, ultimately derived
                  from two basic concepts: (1) modeling gene structure
                  and (2) recognizing sequence similarity. Successful
                  hybrid methods combining these two concepts have
                  also been developed. We present a third orthogonal
                  approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the
                  genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated
                  over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms
                  based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER,
                  which quantify mutational strand biases caused by
                  transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and
                  PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection
                  against polyadenylation signals. We combined these
                  algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST,
                  which we used to predict the location and
                  orientation of thousands of putative transcription
                  units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly
                  predicted transcriptional units do not appear to
                  code for proteins. The new algorithms are
                  particularly apt at detecting genes with long
                  introns and lacking sequence conservation. They
                  therefore complement existing gene prediction
                  methods and will help identify functional
                  transcripts within many apparent \&quot;genomic
                  deserts.\&quot;}

   Abstract="Evolution from unicellular organisms to larger multicellular ones requires matching their needs to the rate of exchange of molecular nutrients with the environment. This logistic problem poses a severe constraint on development. For organisms whose body plan is a spherical shell, such as the volvocine green algae, the current (molecules per second) of needed nutrients grows quadratically with radius, whereas the rate at which diffusion alone exchanges molecules grows linearly, leading to a bottleneck radius beyond which the diffusive current cannot meet metabolic demands. By using Volvox carteri, we examine the role that advection of fluid by the coordinated beating of surface-mounted flagella plays in enhancing nutrient uptake and show that it generates a boundary layer of concentration of the diffusing solute. That concentration gradient produces an exchange rate that is quadratic in the radius, as required, thus circumventing the bottleneck and facilitating evolutionary transitions to multicellularity and germ-soma differentiation in the volvocalean green algae."

	between these regulatory RNAs and their target mRNAs requires the
	Sm-like Hfq protein which most likely functions as an RNA chaperone
	to increase RNA unfolding or local target RNA concentration. Here
	we summarize the physiological roles of the basepairing RNAs, examine
	their prevalence in bacteria and discuss unresolved questions regarding
	their mechanisms of action.},

With the discovery of riboswitches, RNA no longer takes a backseat to protein when it comes to affecting gene expression. Riboswitches bind directly to cellular metabolites with exceptional specificity and affinity, and exert control over gene expression through ligand-induced conformational changes in RNA structure. Riboswitches now represent a widespread mechanism by which cells monitor their metabolic state and facilely alter gene expression in response to changing conditions.}",

publisher={Kluwer Academic Publishers},
year={2002},
user = {rpudimat},
abstract = {Sequence - Evolution - Function is an introduction to the computational approaches that play a critical role in the emerging new branch of biology known as functional genomics. The book provides the reader with an understanding of the principles and approaches of functional genomics and of the potential and limitations of computational and experimental approaches to genome analysis.

Key topics covered in this textbook are: 


the completed and ongoing genome sequencing projects,
 databases that store and organize genomic data, with their unique advantages and pitfalls,
 principles and methods of genome analysis and annotation,
 ways to automate the searches and increase search sensitivity while minimizing the error rate,
 the first lessons from the Human Genome Project,
 the contribution of comparative genomics to the understanding of hereditary diseases and cancer,
 fundamental and practical applications of comparative genomics,
 the use of complete genomes for evolutionary analysis,
 the application of comparative genomics for identification of potential drug targets in microbial genomes, 


Problems for Further Study, which are designed to be solved by using methods available through the World Wide Web. 


Sequence - Evolution - Function should help bridge the "digital divide" between biologists and computer scientists, allowing biologists to better grasp the peculiarities of the emerging field of Genome Biology and to learn how to benefit from the enormous amount of sequence data available in the public databases. The book is non-technical with respect to the computer methods for genome analysis and discusses these methods from the user's viewpoint, without addressing mathematical and algorithmic details. Prior practical familiarity with the basic methods for sequence analysis is a major advantage, but a reader without such experience will be able to use the book as an introduction to these methods. This book is perfect for introductory level courses in computational methods for comparative and functional genomics.

abstract= 	{Biomedical research will be revolutionised by the current efforts to sequence the human genome and the genomes of model organisms. Of the newly sequenced genes, 50 percent code for proteins of unknown functions, while as little as 5 percent of sequences in mammalian genomes code for proteins. New, genome-wide approaches are needed to draw together the knowledge that is emerging simultaneously in a number of fields of genome research. This volume is a high-level survey of the newly emerging concepts of structural biology and functional genomics for biologists, biochemists and medical researchers interested in genome research. Topics included are chromosome and chromatin organisation, novel DNA and RNA structures, DNA flexibility, supercoiling, prediction of protein functions, strategies for large scale structural analysis, and computer modelling.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Aspirin is a popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
	drug, but some patients suffer from hypersensitivity to it. This
	prompted us to identify the factors or molecules related to these
	responses. MATERIAL/METHODS: A commercially available DNA microarray
	was used to study changes in gene expression in human peripheral
	blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after aspirin treatment. The PBMCs
	were collected from a patient with aspirin-intolerant asthma and
	one normal healthy control. RESULTS: We identified 61 and 107 genes
	respectively induced and repressed by aspirin treatment in the PBMCs
	derived from the normal control. In the patient showing aspirin-induced
	asthma responses, 31 genes were up-regulated and 6 were down-regulated
	after aspirin treatment. Among these,1 gene was expressed with the
	same pattern in the control and the patient. In contrast, 19 genes
	showed different expression patterns, and it turned out that most
	of them were involved in immune responses, cell growth/proliferation,
	transcription/translation, and signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These
	results show the molecules involved in hypersensitivity to aspirin
	and may lead to a better understanding of adverse responses to aspirin.
	Furthermore, they can provide clues for identifying novel therapeutic
	and/or preventive molecular targets of the adverse effects of aspirin.},

  abstract =     {Learning networks are commonly categorized in terms of
supervised and unsuper- vised networks. In unsupervised learning, the
training set consists of input training patterns only. In contrast, in
supervised learning networks, the training data consist of many pairs of
input/output patterns. Therefore, the learning process can bene¯t
greatly from the teacher's assistance. In fact, the amount of adjustment
of the up- dating coe±cients often depends on the di®erence between the
desired teacher value and the actual response. As demonstrated in
Chapter 5, many supervised learning models have been found to be
promising for biometric authentication; their imple- mentation often
hinges on an e®ective data-clustering scheme, which is perhaps the most
critical component in unsupervised learning methods. This chapter
addresses a data-clustering algorithm, called the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, when complete or partial
information of observed data is made available.}

	directly by radiometric methods or indirectly through optical changes
	associated with the formation of intermediates and products. {T}he
	kinetics is measured as a function of a second variable such as concentration
	of enzyme or substrate, based on which a model or a kinetic pathway
	is constructed. {T}he kinetic data in most cases are too complex
	and hence best analyzed by computational methods that make no assumptions
	in fitting the data, except for the model chosen by the investigator(7;
	8). {S}everal types of experiments including kinetic and equilibrium
	types are globally fit using numerical and least-squares fitting
	methods to derive a set of intrinsic rate constants that reveals
	the pathway of the enzymatic reaction. {T}he derived model is considered
	a working model that makes predictions, based on which new experiments
	are designed. {T}he results of these experiments are used to refine
	the model.},

                 analysis of gene expression data generated using DNA microarrays. 
		 This type of experiment allows to determine relative levels of mRNA abundance 
		 in a set of tissues or cell populations for thousands of genes simultaneously. 
		 Naturally, such an experiment requires computational and statistical analysis 
		 techniques. At the outset of the processing pipeline, the computational 
		 procedures are largely determined by the technology and experimental setup 
		 that are used. Subsequently, as more reliable intensity values for genes 
		 emerge, pattern discovery methods come into play. The most striking peculiarity 
		 of this kind of data is that one usually obtains measurements for thousands of 
		 genes for only a much smaller number of conditions. This is at the root of 
		 several of the statistical questions discussed here.}

    abstract={
          We describe an extension of Earley's parser for stochastic context-free grammars that computes
	  the following quantities given a stochastic context-free grammar and an input string: 
	  a) probabilities of successive prefixes being generated by the grammar; 
	  b) probabilities of substrings being generated by the nonterminals, 
	      including the entire string being generated by the grammar; 
	  c) most likely (Viterbi) parse of the string; 
	  d) posterior expected number of applications of each grammar production, 
	     as required for reestimating rule probabilities. 
	  Probabilities (a) and (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input. 
	  Our algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in that it 
	  works efficiently on sparse grammars by making use of Earley's top-down control structure. 
	  It can process any context-free rule format without conversion to some normal form, and combines
	   computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm. Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions 
	   for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on 
	   ungrammatical inputs.

  abstract = {The goal of phylogenetics is to reconstruct ancestral relationships
    between different taxa, e.g., different species in the tree of life,
    by means of certain characters, such as genomic sequences. We consider
    the prominent problem of reconstructing the basal phylogenetic tree
    topology when several subclades have already been identified or are
    well known by other means, such as morphological characteristics.
    Whereas most available tools attempt to estimate a fully resolved
    tree from scratch, the profile neighbor-joining (PNJ) method focuses
    directly on the mentioned problem and has proven a robust and efficient
    method for large-scale data sets, especially when used in an iterative
    way. We describe an implementation of this idea, the ProfDist software
    package, which is freely available, and apply the method to estimate
    the phylogeny of the eukaryotes. Overall, the PNJ approach provides
    a novel effective way to mine large sequence datasets for relevant
    phylogenetic information.}

Constraint-based reasoning is a paradigm for formulating knowledge as a set of constraints without specifying the method by which these constraints are to be satised. A variety of techniques have been developed for finding partial or complete solutions for different kinds of constraint expressions. These have been successfully applied to diverse tasks such as design, diagnosis, truth maintenance, scheduling, spatiotemporal reasoning, logic programming and user interface. Constraint networks are graphical representations used to guide strategies for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). }

                  defined in terms of robustness. This paper shows

                  programming model subsuming higher-order functional
                  and object-oriented programming as facets of a
                  general model. This is particularly interesting for
                  concurrent object-oriented programming, for which no
                  comprehensive formal model existed until now. The
                  model can be extended so that it can express
                  encapsulated problem solvers generalizing the
                  problem solving capabilities of constraint logic
                  programming. OPM has been developed together with a
                  concomitant programming language Oz, which is
                  designed for applications that require complex
                  symbolic computations, organization into multiple
                  agents, and soft real-time control. An efficient,
                  robust, and interactive implementation of Oz is

  abstract =     {Bei praktisch allen Prozessen innerhalb einer Zelle
                  spielen Protein-ProteinInteraktionen eine wesentlich
                  Rolle [1,2]. So bestehen alle strukurgebenden Elemente
                  einer Zelle wie Aktinfilamente oder Mikrotubuli aus
                  Proteinkomplexen, die durch Proteininteraktionen
                  zusammengehalten werden. Aber auch viele Enzyme sind
                  aus Untereinheiten zusammengesetzt, die ihre volle
                  Aktivität nur im Verbund entfalten können. Ein
                  willkürlich gewähltes Beispiel aus vielen Hundert
                  Proteinkomplexen einer Zelle sind die RNA-Polymerasen,
                  deren Untereinheiten nicht nur vielfache
                  Proteininteraktionen eingehen, sondern zugleich auch
                  mit DNA und RNA, ihrem Enzymprodukt, interagieren
                  müssen. Hinzu kommen noch Interaktionen mit
                  niedermolekularen Substanzen wie Zucker, Fetten oder
                  Salzen. Die Wechselwirkung von Proteinen mit anderen
                  Molekülen wird in diesem Kapitel jedoch aus
                  Platzgründen nicht behandelt. Man sollte sich diese
                  Interaktionen aber im Hinterkopf behalten, zumal sie
                  den Stoffwechsel einer Zelle weitgehend
                  prägen. Klassifikation und Spezifität: Proteindomänen
                  Aufgrund ihrer Vielfalt ist es nahezu unmöglich,
                  Proteininteraktionen sinnvoll zu
                  klassifizieren. Willkürlich kann man sie in starke
                  ("stabile") und schwache ("transiente") Interaktionen
                  einteilen, wobei die Übergänge allerdings fliessend
                  sind. Viele Proteinkomplexe sind relativ stabil
                  assoziiert, da ihre Integrität für ihre Funktion
                  essentiell ist. So bleiben Ribosomen als
                  Protein-RNA-Komplexe im wesentlichen stabil während
                  selbst formgebende Komplexe wie Aktinfilamente laufend
                  auf- und abgebaut werden. Obwohl viele
                  Proteininteraktionen extrem spezifisch sein müssen,
                  zum Beispiel bei der Bindung eines Peptidhormons wie
                  Insulin an seinen Rezeptor, scheinen viele schwache
                  Interaktionen relativ unspezifisch und damit oft ohne
                  Bedeutung zu sein. Solange diese Interaktionen dem
                  Organismus aber keinen Nachteil verschaffen, werden
                  sie einfach ohne Konsequenzen toleriert. Solche
                  unspezifischen Wechselwirkungen dürfen aber trotzdem
                  nicht mit zufälligen Zusammenstössen durch die
                  Brownsche Bewegung verwechselt werden, da letztere
                  keinerlei Zusammenhalt bewirken. Schwache
                  Interaktionen dürften aber für die Evolution eine
                  wichtige Rolle spielen, da sie durch Mutation und
                  Selektion verstärkt und dadurch nutzbar gemacht werden
                  können. Biologisch sinnvoller ist die Klassifikation
                  nach Proteindomänen [3,4]. Domänen sind die
                  strukturellen und funktionellen Einheiten von
                  Proteininteraktionen. Sie falten sich unabhängig von
                  anderen Teilen eines Proteins, sind meist globulär und
                  ihre Länge liegt in der Regel zwischen 40 und 150
                  Aminosäuren (Abb. 1). Vielen Domänen kann man
                  bestimmte Interaktionseigenschaften zuordnen, so
                  binden z.B. die SH3-Domänen an prolinreiche Sequenzen,
                  die SH2-Domänen an Peptidsequenzen, die
                  Phospho-Tyrosin enthalten usw. Die letzen beiden
                  Domänen wurden nach ihrer Homologie mit dem
                  Onkoprotein Src benannt, welches Sarcome
                  verursacht. Alle Src-verwandten Proteine haben solche
                  Src-Homologie-(SH)-Domänen. Die SH1-Domäne entspricht
                  der KinaseDomäne. Allerdings gibt es unter den ca. 750
                  Proteindomänen des menschlichen Proteoms immer noch
                  zahlreiche Beispiele, deren Bindungseigenschaften kaum
                  oder gar nicht bekannt sind. Selbst wenn man die
                  prinzipielle Fähigkeit einer Domäne kennt, z.B. an
                  prolinreiche Sequenzen zu binden, so ist es praktisch
                  immer noch unmöglich, die Bindungspartner genau
                  vorherzusagen, da es zahlreiche prolinreiche Proteine
                  in den meisten Genomen gibt. Die Vorhersage solcher
                  Interaktionen bleibt daher eine wichtige
                  Herausforderung für Strukturbiologen und
                  Bioinformatiker.}

  abstract =     "The evolution of new genes is distinct from evolution
                 through allelic substitution in that new genes bring
                 with them new degrees of freedom for genetic
                 variability. Selection in the evolution of new genes
                 can therefore act to sculpt the dimensions of
                 variability in the genome. This ``constructional''
                 selection effect is an evolutionary mechanism, in
                 addition to genetic modification, that can affect the
                 variational properties of the genome and its
                 evolvability. One consequence is a form of genic
                 selection: genes with large potential for generating
                 new useful genes when duplicated ought to proliferate
                 in the genome, rendering it ever more capable of
                 generating adaptive variants. A second consequence is
                 that alleles of new genes whose creation produced a
                 selective advantage may be more likely to also produce
                 a selective advantage, provided that gene creation and
                 allelic variation have correlated phenotypic effects. A
                 fitness distribution model is analyzed which
                 demonstrates these two effects quantitatively. These
                 are effects that select on the nature of the
                 genotype-phenotype map. New genes that perturb numerous
                 functions under stabilizing selection, i.e. with high
                 pleiotropy, are unlikely to be advantageous. Therefore,
                 genes coming into the genome ought to exhibit low
                 pleiotropy during their creation. If subsequent
                 offspring genes also have low pleiotropy, then genic
                 selection can occur. If subsequent allelic variation
                 also has low pleiotropy, then that too should have a
                 higher chance of not being deleterious. The effects on
                 pleiotropy are illustrated with two model
                 genotype-phenotype maps: Wagner's linear
                 quantitative-genetic model with Gaussian selection, and
                 Kauffman's ``NK'' adaptive landscape model.
                 Constructional selection is compared with other
                 processes and ideas about the evolution of constraints,
                 evolvability, and the genotype-phenotype map. Empirical
                 phenomena such as dissociability in development,
                 morphological integration, and exon shuffling are
                 discussed in the context of this evolutionary process.

   abstract = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.}

    used for the individual descriptions. The questionnaires were
    filled out by the developers. Since there might always be relevant
    pieces of information that do not fit well in such a

    description.  Most developers took advantage of this opportunity
    and attached a brief summary of their system.}

                  programming framework. The first contribution of the
                  paper is a set of branch-and-bound techniques that
                  improves substantially the performance o falgorithms
                  based on constraint propagation and the second
                  contribution is the i ntroduction of weighted
                  matching as a global constraint (
                  MinWeightAllDifferent) ,that can be propagated using
                  specialized incremental algorithms from Operations
                  Research. We first compare programming techniques
                  that use constraint propagati onwith specialized
                  algorithms from Operations Research, such as the
                  Busaker and Gowen flow algorithm or the Hungarian
                  method. Although CLP is shown not to becom petitive
                  with specialized polynomial algorithms for "pure"
                  matching problems, th e situation is different as
                  soon as the problems are modified with additionalcon
                  straints. Using the previously mentioned set of
                  techniques, a simpler branch-and bound algorithm
                  based on constraint propagation can outperform a
                  complexspeciali zed algorithm. These techniques have
                  been applied with success to the Traveling Salesman
                  Problems [CL 97], which can be seen as an augmented
                  matchingproblem. We also show that an incremental
                  version of the Hugarian method can be used to pro
                  pagate a weighted matching MinWeightAllDifferent
                  constraint. This is anextensio n to the weighted
                  case of the work of Re'gin [Re' 94], which we show
                  to bring si gnificant improvements on a timetabling

lso plays an important role. Indeed, the representation of decision trees is fully expressive theoretically, but it is often im
practical to learn such a representation with accurate probability estimates from limited training data. In this paper, we exte
nd decision trees to represent a joint distribution and conditional independence, called conditional independence trees (CITree
s), which is a more suitable model for PETs. We propose a novel algorithm for learning CITrees, and our experiments show that t

                  estimate the model as a whole from labeled sequences instead 
                  of estimating the individual parts independently from 
                  subsequences. It is argued that the standard maximum 
                  likelihood estimation criterion is not optimal for training 
                  such a model. Instead of maximizing the probability of the 
                  DNA sequence, one should maximize the probability of the 
                  correct prediction. Such a criterion, called conditional 
                  maximum likelihood, is used for the gene finder 'HMM-gene'. 
                  A new (approximative) algorithm is described, which finds 
                  the most probable prediction summed over all paths yielding 
                  the same prediction. We show that these methods contribute 
                  significantly to the high performance of HMMgene.}

                  involve some constraints similar to the alldifferent
                  constraints. These constraints are called constraints
                  of difference. They are defined on a subset of
                  variables by a set of tuples for which the values
                  occuring in the same tuple are all different. In this
                  paper, a new filtering algorithm for these constraints
                  is presented. It achieves the generalized
                  arc-consistency condition for these non-binary
                  constraints. It is based on matching theory and its
                  complexity is low. In fact, for a constraint defined
                  on a subset of p variables having domains of
                  cardinality at most d, its space complexity is O(pd)
                  and its time complexity is O(p2d2). This filtering
                  algorithm has been successfully used in the system
                  RESYN [Vismara et al., 1992], to solve the subgraph

Thanks to its increasing availability, electronic literature can now be a major source of information when developing com- plex statistical models where data is scarce or contains much noise. This raises the question of how to integrate informa- tion from domain literature with statistical data. Because quantifying similarities or dependencies between variables is a basic building block in knowledge discovery, we consider here the following question. Which vector representations of text and which statistical scores of similarity or dependency support best the use of literature in statistical models? For the text source, we assume to have annotations for the do- main variables as short free-text descriptions and optionally to have a large literature repository from which we can fur- ther expand the annotations. For evaluation, we contrast the variable similarities or dependencies obtained from text using di erent annotation sources and vector representa- tions with those obtained from measurement data or expert assessments. Speci cally, we consider two learning prob- lems: clustering and Bayesian network learning. Firstly, we report performance (against an expert reference) for clus- tering yeast genes from textual annotations. Secondly, we assess the agreement between text-based and data-based scores of variable dependencies when learning Bayesian net- work substructures for the task of modeling the joint distri- bution of clinical measurements of ovarian tumors.

  We developed a dynamic programming approach of computing common
  sequence/structure patterns between two RNAs given by their sequence
  and secondary structures. Common patterns between two RNAs are meant
  to share the same local sequential and structural properties.
  Nucleotides which are part of an RNA are linked together due to
  their phosphodiester or hydrogen bonds. These bonds describe the way
  how nucleotides are involved in patterns and thus delivers a
  bond-preserving matching definition. Based on this definition, we
  are able to compute all patterns between two RNAs in time O(nm)
  and space O(nm), where n and m are the lengths of the RNAs,
  respectively.  Our method is useful for describing and detecting
  local motifs and for detecting local regions of large RNAs although
  they do not share global similarities.

is through facial expressions. In this paper, we report on
several advances we have made in building a system for
classification of facial expressions from continuous video
input. We use Bayesian network classifiers for classifying
expressions from video. One of the motivating factor in using the Bayesian network classifiers is their ability to handle
missing data, both during inference and training. In particular, we are interested in the problem of learning with both
labeled and unlabeled data. We show that when using unlabeled data to learn classifiers, using correct modeling
assumptions is critical for achieving improved classification
performance. Motivated by this, we introduce a classification driven stochastic structure search algorithm for learning
the structure of Bayesian network classifiers. We show that
with moderate size labeled training sets and large amount
of unlabeled data, our method can utilize unlabeled data to
improve classification performance. We also provide results
using the Naive Bayes (NB) and the Tree-Augmented Naive
Bayes (TAN) classifiers, showing that the two can achieve
good performance with labeled training sets, but perform
poorly when unlabeled data are added to the training set}

                  believed that the {\em hydrophobic force} is the

                  backbone $\alpha$-carbon atoms in PDB data, by

A regular path expression is a subterm relation,

                 structure and func­ tion at rates comparable to current
                 gene­sequencing technol­ ogy. To develop such methods,
                 new algorithms are required that can quickly extract
                 significantly more structural infor­ mation from sparse
                 experimental data. This paper presents a new class of
                 signal processing algorithms for nuclear mag­ netic
                 resonance (NMR) structural biology, based on time­
                 frequency analysis of chemical shift dynamics. A novel
                 approach to multidimensional NMR analysis is proposed
                 in which the data are interpreted in the time­frequen­
                 cy domain, as opposed to the traditional frequency
                 domain. Time­frequency analysis (TFA) exposes behavior
                 orthogo­ nal to the magnetic coherence transfer

                 discovery. An implementa­ tion yielding new biophysical

                 the heretofore unknown presence of through­space

                  mapping from genotype to phenotype. One property of
                  these mappings is neutrality, where any mutations do
                  not have an appreciable effect on the phenotype. In
                  this case the mapping from genotype to phenotype
                  contains redundancy such that a phenotype is
                  represented by many genotypes. Studies of RNA and
                  protein molecules, the fundamental building blocks
                  of life, reveal that this can result in neutral
                  networks - sets of genotypes connected by a single
                  point mutation that map into the same
                  phenotype. This allows genetic changes to be made
                  while maintaining the current phenotype and thus
                  reduce the chance of becomming mapped into
                  suboptimal regions of genotype space. In this paper
                  we present several redundant mappings and explore
                  their properties by performing random walks on the
                  neutral networks in their genotype spaces. We
                  investigate whether the properties found in nature's
                  search space can be engineered into our artificial
                  evolutionary systems. A mapping based on random
                  boolean network was found to give particularly

  bad atomic clashes involving rotamers are represented as
  constraints. We present a new side-chain placement method that uses a

  successively tighter side-chain packing constraints. By using these
  programs iteratively our method produces side-chain conformation
  predictions whose accuracy is comparable with that of other
  methods. The resulting system provides a testbed for evaluating the

Molecular species are naturally represented by graphs, which are identified by their vertices and edges where vertices are atom types and edges are bonds. The mechanism is generated using a set of reaction patterns (sub-graphs) that are the internal representations for a given class of reaction thus eliminating the possibility of generating unimportant product species a priori. Furthermore, each molecule is canonically represented by a set of topological indices (Connectivity Index, Balaban Index, Schulz TI Index, WID Index, and others) thus it eliminates the probability for regenerating the same species twice. Theoretical background and application to combustion of hydrocarbon system are presented. }

                  (1993) individually proposed tunneling
                  algorithms. The tunneling algorithms employ analogy
                  to the tunnel effect in physics, and are used to
                  optimize continuous systems. The present paper
                  proposes a method of solving combinatorial problems
                  using a type of randomized dynamic tunneling
                  technique. This method is based on a computational
                  model called CCM*. CCM* is an extended version of
                  the Chemical Casting Model (CCM). CCM was proposed
                  by the author toward developing a method of solving
                  open and incompletely-specified problems that may
                  change while being solved, using self-organizing
                  computation. The 0-1 integer programming problem is
                  solved using CCM* with a very simple rule and an
                  evaluation function. CCM* allows one to escape from
                  local maxima by composing the rule dynamically and

When modeling a probability distribution with a Bayesian network, we
are faced with the problem of how to handle continuous variables.
Most previous work has either solved the problem by discretizing, or
assumed that the data are generated by a single Gaussian. In this
paper we abandon the normality assumption and instead use statistical
methods for nonparametric density estimation. For a naive Bayesian
classifier, we present experimental results on a variety of natural
and artificial domains, comparing two methods of density estimation:
assuming normality and modeling each conditional distribution with a
single Gaussian; and using nonparametric kernel density estimation.
We observe large reductions in error on several natural and
artificial data sets, which suggests that kernel estimation is a
useful tool for learning Bayesian models.

                  models consider spatial properties such as shape and
                  extension as well as thematic attributes. We introduce
                  3D shape histograms as an intuitive and powerful
                  approach to model similarity for solid objects such as
                  molecules. Errors of measurement, sampling, and
                  numerical rounding may result in small displacements
                  of atomic coordinates. These effects may be handled by
                  using quadratic form distance functions. An efficient
                  processing of similarity queries based on quadratic
                  forms is supported by a filter-refinement

    asymptotic complexity from O(d+2/2*2^d) to O(2^d). The savings is
    much less in a partial tree search, or in a heavily pruned
    tree. We also show that the overhead of the improved algorithm on
    a uniform-depth b-ary tree is only a factor of b/(b-1)
    compared to depth-first search. This constant factor is greater on
    a heavily pruned tree. Finally, we present empirical results

    of problem difficulty, on the NP-Complete problem of number

First, individually discriminatory genes (IDGs) are identified by using weighted Fisher Criterion (wFC). Second, jointly discriminatory genes (JDGs) are selected by a sequential search method, according to their joint class separability. To combat the small size effect on feature selection, leave-one-out procedures are incorporated into both IDG and JDG selection steps to improve the robustness of the approach. By applying this approach to a microarray study of small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs) of childhood, we have demonstrated that our robust feature selection method can be used to successfully identify a subset of genes with superior classification performance for multiclass prediction.},

improvement search over completesolutions. On the contrary, many
problems have effective greedy heuristics for constructing
solutions,making a tree-structured search space more appropriate. The
second is that stochastic tree searchalgorithms should explore the
same space of decisions as systematic methods. Constructing
searchtrees in the traditional manner, by choosing the default
variable at the parent and valuing it differentlyat each child, makes
sense for efficient complete search, but is not necessarily the best
choice for in-complete methods. In an empirical study using the
combinatorial optimization problem of number par-titioning, I show
that the opposite approach, choosing a different variable at each
child and giving itthe default value, can be a good choice for
incomplete stochastic algorithms.}

                  molecule is a sequence of nucleotides (bases) over the
                  four-letter alphabet fA; C; G; U g. The secondary
                  structure of an RNA is a set of base-pairs (nucleotide
                  pairs) which formed bonds between A \Gamma  U and C
                  \Gamma  G. These bonds have been traditional assumed
                  to be noncrossing in the secondary structure. This
                  implies a tree representation of the secondary
                  structure of RNA molecule. 

                  This paper considers several notions of similarity
                  between two RNA molecule structures taking into
                  account both the primary and the secondary
                  structures. We consider a natural tree representation
                  with both primary and secondary structure data. We
                  present efficient algorithms for comparing such tree
                  representation. We then show that some of these
                  similarity notions can be used to solve the structure
                  prediction problem when the structure of a closely
                  related RNA is known.}

                  from the knowledge of the primary structure (the
                  sequence of bases) is still a challenging
                  task. There are algorithms that provide good results
                  e.g. based on the search for an energetic optimal
                  configuration. However the output of such algorithms
                  does not always give the real folding of the

                  using a stochastic context-free grammar and

                  by any algorithm. In this way it will be possible to
                  identify those predictions which are close to the
                  natural folding of the molecule with a probability

generalization of these previous efforts by using stochastic methods
to guide and speed up the search
of derivation trees for successful branches. By spending
computational effort to exercise the stochastic
solver at various nodes in the derivation tree, additional
information is obtained to suggest (a) delaying
exploration of unpromising subtrees and (b) visiting promising
children first. Using these simple
guidelines we give three example search strategies extending the
basic depth-first search procedure used
typically in CLP systems. Each extension exhibits a different degree
of interaction and cooperation between
the principal CLP solver and the stochastic solver. While

                  algorithms for the protein folding problem in the
                  hydrophobic-hydrophilic model (Dill, 1985). Our
                  algorithms are the first approximation algorithms in
                  the literature with guaranteed performance for this
                  model (Dill, 1994). The hydrophobic-hydrophilic model
                  abstracts the dominant force of protein folding: the
                  hydrophobic interaction. The protein is modeled as a
                  chain of amino acids of length n that are of two
                  types; H (hydrophobic, i.e., nonpolar) and P
                  (hydrophilic, i.e., polar). Although this model is a
                  simplification of more complex protein folding models,
                  the protein folding structure prediction problem is
                  notoriously difficult for this model. Our algorithms
                  have linear (3n) or quadratic time and achieve a
                  three-dimensional protein conformation that has a
                  guaranteed free energy no worse than three-eighths of
                  optimal. This result answers the open problem of Ngo
                  et al. (1994) about the possible existence of an
                  efficient approximation algorithm with guaranteed
                  performance for protein structure prediction in any
                  well-studied model of protein folding. By achieving
                  speed and near-optimality simultaneously, our
                  algorithms rigorously capture salient features of the
                  recently proposed framework of protein folding by Sali
                  et al. (1994). Equally important, the final
                  conformations of our algorithms have significant
                  secondary structure (antiparallel sheets, beta-sheets,
                  compact hydrophobic core). Furthermore, hypothetical
                  folding pathways can be described for our algorithms
                  that fit within the framework of diffusion-collision
                  protein folding proposed by Karplus and Weaver
                  (1979). Computational limitations of algorithms that
                  compute the optimal conformation have restricted their
                  applicability to short sequences (length < or =
                  90). Because our algorithms trade computational
                  accuracy for speed, they can construct near-optimal
                  conformations in linear time for sequences of any
                  size.",

                  1,964 of 19,156 (10%) loci examined contain one or more such 
                  alternative splicing events, with 2,698 total events. These 
                  events represent a lower bound on the amount of alternative 
                  splicing in the human genome. Also, as these alternative 
                  splicing events are conserved between the human and mouse 
                  transcriptomes they should be enriched for functionally 
                  significant alternative splicing events, free from much of 
                  the noise found in the EST libraries. Further classification 
                  of these alternative splicing events reveals that 1,037 
                  (38.4%) are due to exon skipping, 497 (18.4%) are due to 
                  alternative 3' splice sites, 214 (7.9%) are due to 
                  alternative 5' splice sites, 75 (2.8%) are due to intron 
                  retention and the other 875 (32.4%) are due to other, more 
                  complicated, alternative splicing events. In addition, 
                  genomic sequences nearby these alternative splicing events 
                  display increased sequence conservation. Both the 
                  alternatively spliced exons and the proximal intron show 
                  increased levels of genomic conservation relative to 
                  constitutively spliced exons. For exon skipping events both 
                  intron regions flanking the exon are conserved while for 
                  alternative 5' and 3' splicing events the conservation is 
                  greater near the alternative splice site.}

                  mammalian mRNAs, yet many questions remain on its downstream 
                  effects on protein function. To this end, we assessed the 
                  impact of gene structure and splice variation on signal 
                  peptide and transmembrane regions in proteins. Transmembrane 
                  proteins perform several key functions in cell signaling and 
                  transport, with their function tied closely to their 
                  transmembrane architecture. Signal peptides and 
                  transmembrane regions both provide key information on 
                  protein localization. Thus, any modification to such regions 
                  will likely alter protein destination and function. We 
                  applied TMHMM and SignalP to a nonredundant set of proteins, 
                  and assessed the effects of gene structure and alternative 
                  splicing on predicted transmembrane and signal peptide 
                  regions. These regions were altered by alternative splicing 
                  in roughly half of the cases studied. Transmembrane regions 
                  are divided by introns slightly less often than expected 
                  given gene structure and transmembrane region size. However, 
                  the transmembrane regions in single-pass transmembranes are 
                  divided substantially less often than expected. This 
                  suggests that intron placement might be subject to some 
                  evolutionary pressure to preserve function in these 
                  signaling proteins. The data described in this paper is

  reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from sequences of current-day
  taxa.  A well supported approach to tree reconstruction performs
  maximum likelihood (ML) analysis. Unfortunately, searching for the
  maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is computationally
  expensive. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that uses
  Structural-EM for learning maximum likelihood trees. This algorithm
  is similar to the standard EM method for estimating branch lengths,
  except that dur- ing iterations of this algorithms the topology is
  improved as well as the branch length. The algorithm performs
  iterations of two steps. In the E-Step, we use the current tree
  topology and branch lengths to compute expected sufficient statistics,
  which summarize the data. In the M-Step, we search for a topology
  that maximizes the likelihood with respect to these expected
  sufficient statistics. As we show, searching for better topologies
  inside the M-step can be done efficiently, as opposed to standard
  search over topologies. We prove that each iteration of this
  procedure increases the likelihood of the topology, and thus the
  procedure must converge. We evaluate our new algorithm on both
  synthetic and real sequence data, and show that it is both
  dramatically faster and finds more plausible trees than standard
  search for maximum likelihood phylogenies.},

                  can identify relevant regions of the sequence. This 
                  observation has many potential applications to detecting 
                  functional regions of proteins. However, identifying such 
                  sequence regions automatically is difficult in practice, as 
                  relatively few types of information have enough annotated 
                  sequences to perform this analysis. Our approach addresses 
                  this data scarcity problem by combining text and sequence 
                  analysis. First, we train a text classifier over the 
                  explicit textual annotations available for some of the 
                  sequences in the dataset, and use the trained classifier to 
                  predict the class for the rest of the unlabeled sequences. 
                  We then train a joint sequence text classifier over the text 
                  contained in the functional annotations of the sequences, 
                  and the actual sequences in this larger, automatically 
                  extended dataset. Finally, we project the classifier onto 
                  the original sequences to determine the relevant regions of 
                  the sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
                  approach by predicting protein sub-cellular localization and 
                  determining localization specific functional regions of 
                  these proteins.}

                  participation of residues in the hydrophobic core and the 
                  secondary structure of native protein has a rather modest 
                  correlation with the experimentally found phi values 
                  characterizing the participation of residues in the folding 
                  nuclei. Then we tried to find the nuclei as the free energy 
                  saddle points on the network of the folding/unfolding 
                  pathways using the branch-and-bound technique and dynamic 
                  programming. We also attempted to estimate the phi values 
                  from solving of kinetic equations for the network of protein 
                  folding/unfolding pathways. These approaches give a better

                  is consistent with the experimentally observed rapid folding

                  construction and local-search phases of the best
                  heuristics for multiple sequence alignment is that of
                  aligning the columns of two multiple alignments. When
                  the scoring function is the sum-of-pairs objective and
                  induced pairwise alignments are evaluated using linear
                  gap-costs, we call this problem Aligning
                  Alignments. While seemingly a straightforward
                  extension of two-sequence alignment, we prove it is
                  actually NP-complete. As explained in the paper, this
                  provides the first demonstration that minimizing
                  linear gap-costs, in the context of multiple sequence
                  alignment, is inherently hard.We also develop an exact
                  algorithm for Aligning Alignments that is remarkably
                  efficient in practice, both in time and space. Even
                  though the problem is NP-complete, computational
                  experiments on both biological and simulated data show
                  we can compute optimal alignments for all benchmark
                  instances in two standard datasets, and solve
                  very-large random instances with highly-gapped

language Oz to implement non-basic constraints as propagators. The
programmer benefits from the advantages of a high-level language, like
elegant and 
concise coding, in conjunction with efficiency. For the user it
is transparent whether a constraint is implemented by an Oz procedure or
through the interface. The interface is completely separated from the
underlying Oz implementation. Moreover, it frees the user from tedious
tasks like suspending and waking up constraints.

The overall efficiency of the resulting system is comparable to existing
finite domain systems. For scheduling applications we demonstrate how
algorithms from Operations Research can be incorporated, which allows to
obtain results comparable to commercially available systems.},

has focused on algorithms that learn
from a combination of tagged and untagged data. Such algorithms can be referred to as semi-supervised in contrast
to unsupervised, which refers to algorithms requiring no tagged data whatsoever. This paper presents a Bayesian
approach to semi-supervised learning.
In this approach, the parameters of a
probability model are estimated using
Bayesian techniques and then used to
perform classification. The prior probability distribution is formulated from
the tagged data via a process akin to
stochastic generalization.
Intuitively,
the generalization process starts with a
small amount of tagged data and adds
to it new pseudo-counts that are similar to those that would be expected in a
larger data sample from the same population. The prior distribution together
with the untagged data form the posterior distribution which is used to estimate the model parameters via the EM
algorithm.

                  sequences. By identifying a complete set of linked clusters, 
                  "islands," we devise a method which accurately predicts the 
                  extremal score statistics by using only one to a few 
                  pairwise alignments. The success of our method relies 
                  crucially on the link between the statistics of island 
                  scores and extremal score statistics. This link is motivated 
                  by heuristic arguments, and firmly established by extensive 
                  numerical simulations for a variety of scoring parameter 
                  settings and sequence lengths. Our approach is several 
                  orders of magnitude faster than the widely used shuffling 
                  method, since island counting is trivially incorporated into 
                  the basic Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm with minimal 
                  computational cost, and all islands are counted in a single 
                  alignment. The availability of a rapid and accurate 
                  significance estimation method gives one the flexibility to 
                  fine tune scoring parameters to detect weakly homologous

    The paper is concerned with two-class active
learning. While the common approach for collecting data in active learning is to select samples
close to the classification boundary, better performance can be achieved by taking into account
the prior data distribution. The main contribution
of the paper is a formal framework that incorporates clustering into active learning. The
algorithm first constructs a classifier on the set of the
cluster representatives, and then propagates the
classification decision to the other samples via a
local noise model. The proposed model allows
to select the most representative samples as well
as to avoid repeatedly labeling samples in the
same cluster. During the active learning process,
the clustering is adjusted using the coarse-to-fine
strategy in order to balance between the advantage of large clusters and the accuracy of the data
representation. The results of experiments in image databases show a better performance of our
algorithm compared to the current methods.

                  extended from our previous gene classification artificial

                  detection of distant relationships. These include an n-gram 
                  term weighting algorithm for extracting local motif 
                  patterns, and integrated neural networks for combining 
                  global and local sequence information. The system has been 
                  tested with three protein families of electron transferases, 
                  namely cytochrome c, cytochrome b and flavodoxin, with a 
                  100% sensitivity and more than 99.6% specificity. The 
                  accuracy of MOTIFIND is comparable to the BLAST database 
                  search method, but its speed is more than 20 times faster. 
                  The system is much more robust than the PROSITE search which 
                  is based on simple signature patterns. MOTIFIND also 
                  compares favorably with the BLIMPS search of BLOCKS in 
                  detecting fragmentary sequences lacking complete motif 
                  regions. The method has the potential to become a full-scale

                  constraint optimization problems where a limited
                  number of leading solutions are needed. An important
                  class of optimization algorithms use A*, a variant of
                  best first search, to guide the search effectively,
                  while employing a heuristic evaluation func- tion that
                  is computed using dynamic programming. A key
                  bottleneck, however, is that significant effort can be
                  wasted precomputing bounds that are not used to
                  generate the leading solutions. This paper intro-
                  duces a method for solving semi-ring CSPs, based on a
                  variant of A* that generates on demand, only those
                  bounds that are specifically re- quired in order to
                  generate a next best solution. On demand bound
                  computation is performed using "lazy", best-first
                  variants of constraint projection and combination
                  operators, and a scheme that coordinates the
                  computation of these operators by exploiting a
                  decomposition of the optimization problem into a tree
                  structure. We demonstrate a significant performance

                  processes, using only mRNA expression data is not sufficient

balanced incomplete block design generation). Both show strong

negative effect on the incomplete search algorithms. This suggests an
opposite strategy when applying stochastic search: maximising
symmetry in the constraint model.}

                  of specific variants of H systems (e.g. with regular
                  sets of rules) and proves that we can construct
                  universal computers based on various types of H
                  systems with a finite set of splicing rules as well
                  as a finite set of axioms, i.e. we show the
                  theoretical possibility to design programmable
                  universal DNA computers based on the splicing
                  operation. For H systems working in the multiset
                  style (where the numbers of copies of all available
                  strings are counted) we elaborate how a Turing
                  machine computing a partial recursive function can
                  be simulated by an equivalent H system computing the
                  same function; in that way, from a universal Turning
                  machine we obtain a universal H system. Considering
                  H systems as language generating devices we have to
                  add various simple control mechanisms (checking the
                  presence/absence of certain symbols in the spliced
                  strings) to systems with a finite set of splicing
                  rules as well as with a finite set of axioms in
                  order to obtain the full computational power,
                  i.e. to get a characterization of the family of
                  recursively enumerable languages. We also introduce
                  test tube systems, where several H systems work in
                  parallel in their tubes and from time to time the
                  contents of each tube are redistributed to all tubes
                  according to certain separation conditions. By the
                  construction of universal test tube systems we show
                  that also such systems could serve as the
                  theoretical basis for the development of biological

A new database system named KEGG is being organised to computerize
functional aspects of genes and genomes in terms of the binary relations
of interacting molecules or genes. We are currently working on the
metabolic pathway database that is composed of three interconnected
sections: genes, molecules, and pathways, which are also linked to a
number of existing databases through our DBGET retrieval system. Here we
present the basic concept of binary relations and hierarchical
classifications to represent the metabolic pathway data. The database
operations are then defined as an extension of the relational operations,
and the path computation problem is considered as a deduction from binary
relations. An example of using KEGG for the functional prediction of
genomic sequences is presented.}

                  with an architecture that corresponds closely to the 
                  biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of 
                  states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on 
                  the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic

                  loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are 
                  used to model short and long loops separately, which 
                  corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane

                  information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain 
                  a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints 
                  involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood 
                  and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment 
                  of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross 
                  validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane HMM, 
                  TMHMM, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77% of the 
                  sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known 
                  topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset 
                  of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with 
                  existing methods.}

one found first by the variable and value ordering heuristics. We
describe an implementation of SBDS in ILOG Solver, and applications
to low autocorrelation binary sequences and the nqueens problem. We
discuss how SBDS can be applied when there are too many symmetries to
reason with individually, and give applications in graph colouring
and Ramsey theory.}

                 considering both the predicted relevance and its value
                 as a training observation. The experimental result on
                 the FBIS document corpus shows that the ATF algorithm

                  automatically generating gene regulatory networks from raw 
                  data. The algorithm is based on an epistemics approach of 
                  conjecture (hypothesis formation) and refutation (hypothesis 
                  testing). These operations are performed on a matrix 
                  representation of the gene network. Our approach also 
                  provides a way of incorporating external biological 
                  knowledge into the model. This is done by pre-assigning 
                  portions of the matrix--which represent previously known 
                  background knowledge. This background knowledge helps make 
                  the results closer to a human's rendition of such networks. 
                  We illustrate our approach by having the computer replicate 
                  a gene regulatory network generated by human scientists at 
                  an academic lab.}

We show in this paper that many popular models of folding and/or alignment
may be described by a new formalism: multi-tape S-attribute grammars
(MT-SAG's). This formalism relieves the designer of biological models of
implementation details which may hinder his inventiveness. To complete
this formalism, we designed and implemented a tool which, given a MTSAG,
will output an efficient parser for this grammar. We also show that
MTSAG's offer a new, efficient and useful way to handle stochastic
context-free grammars and tools that generate them.}

  abstract={The problem of fast searching of a pattern that contains
  Classes of characters and Bounded size Gaps (CBG) in a text has a
  wide range of applications, among which a very important one is
  protein pattern matching (for instance, one PROSITE protein site is
  associated with the CBG [RK] x(2; 3) [DE] x(2; 3) Y , where the
  brackets match any of the letters inside, and x(2; 3) a gap of
  length between 2 and 3). Currently, the only way to search a CBG in
  a text is to convert it into a full regular expression
  (RE). However, an RE is more sophisticated than a CBG, and searching
  it with an RE pattern matching algorithm complicates the search and
  makes it slow. This is the reason why we design in this article two
  new practical CBG matching algorithms, that are much simpler and
  faster than all the RE search techniques. The first one looks
  exactly once at each text character. The second one does not need to
  consider all the text characters and hence it is usually faster than
  the first one, but in bad cases may have to read the same text
  character more than once. We then propose a criterion based on the
  form of the CBG to choose a-priori the fastest between both. We
  performed many practical experiments using the PROSITE database, and
  all them show that our algorithms are the fastest in virtually all
  cases.},

abstract= {The complexity of the global organization and internalstructures 
	   of motifs in higher eukaryotic organisms raises significant challenges 
	   for motif detection techniques. Toachieve successful de novo motif detection 
	   it is necessary to model the complex dependencies within and among motifsand 
	   incorporate biological prior knowledge. In this paper, we present LOGOS, an 
	   integrated LOcal and GlObal mo-tif Sequence model for biopolymer sequences, 
	   which provides a principled framework for developing, modulariz-ing, extending 
	   and computing expressive motif models for complex biopolymer sequence analysis. 
	   LOGOS consistsof two interacting submodels: HMDM, a local alignment model capturing 
	   biological prior knowledge and positionaldependence within the motif local structure; 
	   and HMM, a global motif distribution model modeling frequencies anddependencies 
	   of motif occurrences. Model parameters can be fit using training motifs within an 
	   empirical Bayesianframework. A variational EM algorithm is developed for de novo motif 
	   detection. LOGOS improves over existing mod-els that ignore biological priors and 
	   dependencies in motif structures and motif occurrences, and demonstrates supe-rior 
	   performance on both semi-realistic test data and cisregulatory sequences from yeast 
	   and Drosophila sequenceswith regard to sensitivity, specificity, flexibility and

  					  acid Selenocysteine, which is encoded 
                 by the STOP-codon UGA. For its 
                 insertion it requires a specific mRNA 
                 sequence downstream the UGA-codon that 
                 forms a hairpin-like structure (called 
                 Sec insertion sequence (SECIS)). 
                 Selenoproteins have gained much 
                 interest recently since they are very 
                 important for human health.
                 
                 In contrast, very little is known about 
                 selenoproteins. For example, there is 
                 only one solved crystal structure 
                 available. One reason for this is that 
                 one is not able to produce enough 
                 amount of selenoproteins by using 
                 recombinant expression in a system like
                 E.coli. The reason is that the 
                 insertion mechanisms are different 
                 between E.coli and eukaryotes. Thus, 
                 one has to redesign the human/mammalian 
                 selenoprotein for the expression in 
                 E.coli. In this paper, we introduce an

                 the computational problem involved in 
                 this design, and we present results for

  abstract =	 {The structure of RNA molecules is 
                 often crucial for their function. 
                 Therefore, the inverse folding 
                 problem (designing RNA sequences 
                 that fold into a given structure) 
                 has gained much interest. In this 
                 paper, we show that it is an 
                 important subproblem in the design 
                 of new and recombinant 
                 selenoproteins. Those proteins 
                 contain the 21th amino acid 
                 selenocysteine. For its insertion, 
                 it requires a specific mRNA 
                 sequence and structure. 
                 Selenoproteins are an essential 
                 component of several major metabolic 
                 pathways.
                 
                 Further investigation of 
                 selenoproteins requires the 
                 production of enough amount of pure 
                 protein. Recombinant expression in a 
                 system like E.coli is often used for 
                 it. Since the selenocysteine 
                 insertion mechanisms are different 
                 between E.coli and eukaryotes, one 
                 has to redesign the human/mammalian 
                 selenoprotein for the expression in 
                 E.coli.
                 
                 In an earlier paper, we introduced an 
                 polynomial-time algorithm for solving
                 the computational problem involved in 
                 this design. But there is no energy 
                 criterion considered so far. In this 
                 paper, we combine the algorithm with 
                 several local search strategies to 
                 optimize different energy considering 
                 objective functions and compare them 
                 to each other. This should increase 
                 the probability that the desired 
                 structure is really folded in the 
                 cell. Results for known selenoproteins 
                 are presented.},

{Given a set of N sequences, the Multiple Sequence Alignment problem is to
align these N sequences, possibly with gaps, that brings out the best
commonality of the N sequences. MUSCA is a two-stage approach to the
alignment problem by identifying two relatively simpler sub-problems whose
solutions are used to obtain the alignment of the sequences. We first
discover motifs in the N sequences and then extract an appropriate subset
of compatible motifs to obtain a good alignment. The motifs of interest to
us are the irredundant motifs which are only polynomial in the input size.
In practice, however, the number is much smaller (sub-linear). Notice that
this step aids in a direct N-wise alignment, as opposed to composing the
alignments from lower order (say pairwise) alignments and the solution is
also independent of the order of the input sequences; hence the algorithm
works very well while dealing with a large number of sequences. The second
part of the problem that deals with obtaining a good alignment is solved
using a graph-theoretic approach that computes an induced subgraph
satisfying certain simple constraints. We reduce a version of this problem
to that of solving an instance of a set covering problem, thus offer the
best possible approximate solution to the problem (provided P not
equalNP). Our experimental results, while being preliminary, indicate that
this approach is efficient, particularly on large numbers of long
sequences, and, gives good alignments when tested on biological data such
as DNA and protein sequences. We introduce the the notion of an alignment
number K (2 </= K </= N), a user-controlled parameter, that lends a useful
flexibility to the aligning program: this additional requirement
constrains the alignment to have at least K sequences agree on a
character, whenever possible, in the alignment. The usefulness of the
alignment number is corroborated by the users who view this as a natural
constraint while dealing with a large number of sequences.}

paradigm that appeared in the late 80's and became more and more
popular during the 90's [5]. In a constraint program, the user
specifies a number of constraints. Each constraint defines a relation
between the variables that describe the state of the system under
investigation. The constraint programming tool provides constraint
solving algorithms which infer new constraints from given ones and
which compute solutions, i.e., valuations of the variables satisfying
all the constraints. In concurrent constraint programming, different
computation processes may run concurrently. Interaction is possible
via the constraint store. The store contains all the constraints
currently known about the system. A process may tell the store a new
constraint, or ask the store whether some constraint is entailed by
the information currently available, in which case further action is
taken [4]. Hybrid concurrent constraint programming (Hybrid cc) is an
extension of concurrent constraint programming which allows one to
model and to simulate the temporal evolution of hybrid systems, i.e.,
systems that exhibit both discrete and continuous state changes [3].
Constraints in Hybrid cc may be both algebraic and differential
equations. State changes can be specified using the combinators of
concurrent constraint programming and default logic. The following
example shows how to model in Hybrid cc an interaction between two
genes.}

This increases the space of possible models, enabling the representation of CPTs with a variable number of parameters that depends on the learned local structures. The resulting learning procedure is capable of inducing models that better emulate the real complexity of the interactions present in the data. We describe the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of learning local structures, as well as an empirical evaluation of the proposed method.This evaluation indicates that learning curves characterizing the procedure that exploits the local structure converge faster than these of the standard procedure. Our results also show that networks learned with local structure tend to be more complex (in terms of arcs), yet require less parameters. }

1 Introduction

The idea that living cells and molecular complexes can be viewed as
potential machinic
components dates back to the late 1950s, when Richard Feynman
delivered his
famous paper [4] describing "sub-microscopic" computers.
More recently, several papers
[1, 10, 16] (also see [7, 13]) have advocated the realisation of
massively parallel
computation using the techniques and chemistry of molecular biology.
Adleman describes

                  arcs and a set of crossing arcs, respectively. As the
                  specified RNA functions are determined by the
                  specified molecular confirmation and therefore the
                  specified secondary and tertiary structures, the

                  measure the similarity between two RNA secondary and

		 decision problems with complete knowledge about the world.
		 We extend the CSP framework so as to representdecision problems
		 under incomplete knowledge. The basis of the extension consists
		 in a distinction between control-lable and uncontrollable variables --
		 hence the terminology "mixed CSP" -- and a "solution" gives actually a
		 conditionaldecision. We study the complexity of deciding the consistency
		 of a mixed CSP. As the problem is generally intractable,we propose an
		 algorithm for finding an approximate solution.

and such that no intermediate genome contains
a lethal gene. The main result of this paper is that, appropriately
formulated, this problem is undecidable, even when the underlying
alphabet has only 2 symbols (e.g. two of the bases A,C,G,T).
We prove that asexual evolutionary systems form a universal
computation engine, in the sense that for any
reversible
Turing machine $M$ and input $x$, there is a finite set $K$ of lethal genes,
which can guide the computation, so that all intermediate genomes
are prefixes of (encodings of) configurations in the computation of $M$.
Since reversible Turing machines retain the history of
their entire computation, and are essentially encoded by evolutionary systems,
this
suggests a encoding
mechanism by which
<I> phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny. </I>

                  paRNAss is a software approach to the prediction of such

                  about the secondary structure space of a switching RNA

                  structure comparison. In the positive case, the predicted

                  post-genomic data opens the way for computational
                  methods elucidating the key components that play a
                  role in these mechanisms. One important consequence
                  is the ability to recognize groups of genes that are
                  co-expressed using microarray expression data. We
                  then wish to identify in-silico putative
                  transcription factor binding sites in the promoter
                  regions of these gene, that might explain the
                  co-regulation, and hint at possible regulators. In
                  this paper we describe a simple and fast, yet
                  powerful, two stages approach to this task. Using a
                  rigorous hyper-geometric statistical analysis and a

                  small conserved sequence kernels. These are then
                  stochastically expanded into PSSMs using an EM-like
                  procedure. We demonstrate the utility and speed of
                  our methods by applying them to several data sets
                  from recent literature. We also compare these
                  results with those of MEME when run on the same

     the new model acquires genetic codes for defining the metabolism within a cell. Morphogenesis is regarded
     as an emergent phenomena in this model. A genetic algorithm was used to evolve the genetic rules that
     determine the metabolism of cells. The model also captures intercellular communication, diffusion, and the
     active transport of chemicals. A new coupled map model, super coupled map, is proposed as a
     mathematical foundation for the dynamic behavior of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the
     acquisition of genetic codes for simple metabolic reactions is possible, and a simple process of morphogenesis
     was observed. (12 References).

  represent the joint distribution of transcription factor binding
  sites and of expression levels of a gene in a single
  model. Learning a combined probability model of binding sites and
  expression patterns enables us to improve the clustering of the
  genes based on the discovery of putative binding sites and to
  detect which binding sites and experiments best characterize a
  cluster. To learn such models from data, we introduce a new search
  method that rapidly learns a model according to a Bayesian score. We
  evaluate our method on synthetic data as well as on real data and
  analyze the biological insights it provides.},

                  approaches to protein structure prediction, as well
                  as for investigating general principles of protein
                  folding. So far, one has the problem that either the
                  lattice does not model real protein conformations
                  with good quality, or there is no efficient method
                  known for finding native conformations. We present a
                  constraint-based method that largely improves this
                  situ- ation. It outperforms all existing approaches
                  in lattice protein folding on the type of model we
                  have chosen (namely the HP-model by Lau and
                  Dill[34], which models the important aspect of
                  hydrophobicity). It is the only exact method that
                  has been applied to two different
                  lattices. Furthermore, it is the only exact method
                  for the face-centered cubic lattice. This lattice
                  is important since it has been shown [38] that the
                  FCC lattice can model real protein conformations
                  with coordinate root mean square deviation below 2
                  Angstrom. Our method uses a constraint-based approach. It
                  works by first calculating maximally compact sets
                  of points (hydrophobic cores), and then threading
                  the given HP-sequence to the hydrophobic cores such
                  that the core is occupied by H-monomers.}

                  UGA-codon that forms a hairpin like structure (called
                  Sec insertion sequence (SECIS)). We consider the
                  computational problem of generating new amino acid
                  sequences containing selenocysteine. This requires to
                  find an mRNA sequence that is similar to the
                  SECIS-consensus, that is able to form the secondary
                  structure required for selenocysteine insertion,  and
                  whose translation is maximally similar to the original
                  amino acid sequence. We show that the problem can be
                  solved in  linear time when the structure does not
                  contain pseudoknots.}

    such a hope. The motivation behind depth-bounded discrepancy
    search is that branching heuristics are more likely to be wrong at

This approach is easily seen to generalize other approaches to modeling uncertainty, such as probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures. The lack of structure in a plausibility measure makes it easy for us to add structure on an ``as needed'' basis, letting us examine what is required to ensure that a plausibility measure has certain properties of interest. This gives us insight into the essential features of the properties in question, while allowing us to prove general results that apply to many approaches to reasoning about uncertainty. Plausibility measures have already proved useful in analyzing default reasoning. In this paper, we examine their "algebraic properties", analogues to the use of + and * in probability theory. An understanding of such properties will be essential if plausibility measures are to be used in practice as a representation tool.}

                  In this paper, we present a new approach for studying this 
                  challenging issue. We formulate the binding-site recognition 
                  problem as a cluster identification problem, i.e., to 
                  identify clusters in a data set that exhibit significantly 
                  different features (e.g., density) than the overall 
                  background of the data set. We have developed a general 
                  framework for solving such a cluster identification problem. 
                  The foundation of the framework is a rigorous relationship 
                  between data clusters and subtrees of a minimum spanning 
                  tree (MST) representation of a data set. We have proposed a 
                  formal and general definition of clusters, and have 
                  demonstrated that a cluster is always represented as a 
                  connected component of the MST, and further it corresponds 
                  to a substring of a linear representation of the MST. Hence 
                  a cluster identification problem is reduced to a problem of 
                  finding substrings with certain features, for which 
                  algorithms have been developed. We have applied this 
                  MST-based cluster identification algorithm to a number of 
                  binding site identification problems. The results are highly 
                  encouraging.}

     the new model acquires genetic codes for defining the metabolism within a cell. Morphogenesis is regarded
     as an emergent phenomena in this model. A genetic algorithm was used to evolve the genetic rules that
     determine the metabolism of cells. The model also captures intercellular communication, diffusion, and the
     active transport of chemicals. A new coupled map model, super coupled map, is proposed as a
     mathematical foundation for the dynamic behavior of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the
     acquisition of genetic codes for simple metabolic reactions is possible, and a simple process of morphogenesis
     was observed. (12 References).

Clustering identifies such groups of coexpressed genes, whose upstream regions can then searched for putative regulatory elements. We present two algorithms and an interactive web-based user interface that integrate cluster analysis and motif finding for the analysis of microarray data. Starting from the expression, we present our adaptive quality-based clustering algorithm to define groups of tightly coexpressed genes. The upstream region is then retrieved based on the accession number and gene name. Once the upstream regions are identified, the sequences are analyzed using Gibbs sampling for motif finding to find the over-represented motifs. Our implementation (called Motif Sampler) allows the use of higher-order models for the sequence background.

construction of physical maps of chromosomes from hybridization 
experiments between unique probes and clones of chromosome fragments 
in the presence of error.
Alizadeh, Karp, Weisser and Zweig~\cite{AKWZ94} first considered a 
maximum-likelihood model of the problem that is equivalent to finding 
an ordering of the probes that minimizes a weighted sum of errors,
and developed several effective heuristics. We show that by exploiting 
information about the end-probes of clones, this model can be formulated 
as a weighted Betweenness Problem.
This affords the significant advantage of allowing the well-developed tools
of integer linear-programming and branch-and-cut algorithms to be brought
to bear on physical mapping, enabling us for the first time to solve
small mapping instances to optimality even in the presence of high error.
We also show that by combining the optimal solution of many small 
overlapping Betweenness Problems, one can effectively screen errors 
from larger instances, and solve the edited instance to optimality 
as a Hamming-Distance Traveling Salesman Problem.
This suggests a new combined approach to physical map construction.

  abstract =     {A major challenge in RNA structure analysis is to 
                  infer common catalytic or regulatory functions based
                  on primary sequences and secondary structures. Some
                  programs have been developed that compare RNAs with
                  such given structures. Nevertheless, the most
                  important problem is that it is hard to determine
                  the adopted structures of RNAs which are a necessary
                  prerequisite to numerous applications; once a
                  structure has been assigned to a sequence (e.g. the
                  minimum free energy structure), it influences the
                  output of the programs and thus affects the
                  scientific result, especially when dealing with a
                  set of multiple RNAs. In this paper, we go one step
                  further and analyze distances between RNA structure
                  ensembles. They reflect structural relationships
                  computed basically on base-pairing probability
                  matrices.  We propose a distance measure between two
                  base-pairing probability matrices showing similar or
                  non-similar structural folding behaviour. This
                  includes the detection of shared optimal, suboptimal
                  and local secondary structures. Consequently, our
                  distance measure avoids falling into the trap of
                  fixing specific structures. A pairwise comparison
                  strategy in a set of multiple RNAs leads us to
                  construct a network of structural relationships
                  using the neighbour joining method.  Attempts to
                  predict phylogenetic trees are discussed and
                  demonstrated by means of viral RNAs.},

{\em the most}) important problem in computational biology. This
problem consists of finding the conformation of a protein (i.e., a
sequence of amino-acids) with minimal energy. Because of the
complexity of this problem, simplified models like Dill's HP-lattice
model have become a major tool for investigating general properties of
protein folding. Even for this simplified model, the structure
prediction problem has been shown to be NP-complete.

We describe a constraint formulation of the HP-model structure
prediction problem, present the basic constraints and search
strategy. We then introduce a novel, general technique for excluding
geometrical symmetries in constraint programming. To our knowledge,
this is the first general and declarative technique for excluding
symmetries in constraint programming that can be added to an existing
implementation. Finally, we describe a new lower bound on the energy
of an HP-protein. Both techniques yield an efficient pruning of the
search tree.

strings are aligned on top of each other. The basic modality in the
language (a transpose,
or "slide") rearranges this alignment, and more complex
formulae can be formed using a
syntax reminiscent of regular expressions, in addition to the usual
connectives and quantifiers.
It turns out that the computational counterpart of the string-based
portion of the
logic is the class of multitape two-way finite state automata, which
are devices particularly
well suited for the implementation of string matching. A
computational counterpart of the
full logic is obtained from relational algebra by performing
selection with these devices.

                  model called CCM*. CCM* is an extended version of
                  the Chemical Casting Model (CCM). CCM was proposed
                  by the author toward developing a method of solving
                  open and incompletely-specified problems that may
                  change while being solved, using self-organizing
                  computation. The 0-1 integer programming problem is
                  solved using CCM* with a very simple rule and an
                  evaluation function. CCM* allows one to escape from
                  local maxima by composing the rule dynamically and
                  randomly. This cannot be done by using the original
                  production rule. The author's experiments show that
                  approximate solutions can be found more rapidly by
                  CCM* than by using a branch-and-bound method in the
                  case of 0-1 integer programming. (9 References). }

                  proteins, e.g. as catalytic molecules. Computational
                  prediction of RNA secondary structure is among the few
                  structure prediction problems that can be solved
                  satisfactory in polynomial time. Most work has been

                  is slow. A fundamental dimension of this bottleneck is
                  the absence of rigorous algorithmic methods. A recent
                  excellent survey on structure comparison by Taylor

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymer composed of four bases denoted A, C,
G, and U. It generally is a single-stranded molecule where the bases form
hydrogen bonds within the same molecule leading to structure formation. In
comparing different homologous RNA molecules it is important to consider
both the base sequence and the structure of the molecules. Traditional
alignment algorithms can only account for the sequence of bases, but not
for the base pairings. Considering the structure leads to significant
computational problems because of the dependencies introduced by the base
pairings. In this paper we address the problem of optimally aligning a
given RNA sequence of unknown structure to one of known sequence and
structure. We phrase the problem as an integer linear program and then
solve it using methods from polyhedral combinatorics. In our computational
experiments we could solve large problem instances--23S ribosomal RNA with
more than 1400 bases--a size intractable for former algorithms.}

The discovery of any new gene requires an analysis of the expression
context for that gene. Now that the cDNA and genomic sequencing projects
are progressing at such a rapid rate, high throughput gene expression
screening approaches are beginning to appear to take advantage of that
data. We present a strategy for the analysis for large-scale quantitative
gene expression measurement data from time course experiments. Our
approach takes advantage of cluster analysis and graphical visualization
methods to reveal correlated patterns of gene expression from time series
data. The coherence of these patterns suggests an order that conforms to a
notion of shared pathways and control processes that can be experimentally
verified.}

                  is a sequence of nucleotides (bases) over the

                  tertiary structure of an RNA is a set of base-pairs
                  (nucleotide pairs) which forms bonds between A \Gamma

                  bonds have been traditionally assumed to be

                  We consider the edit distance between two RNA
                  structures. This is a notion of similarity, introduced
                  in [9], between two RNA molecule structures taking

                  that incorporates multiple sequence information. Predicted 
                  tertiary restraints are obtained from multiple sequence 
                  alignments via a two-step process: First, "seed" side chain 
                  contacts are identified from a correlated mutation analysis, 
                  and then, the seed contacts are "expanded" by an inverse 
                  folding algorithm. These predicted restraints are then 
                  incorporated into a lattice based, reduced protein model. 
                  Depending upon fold complexity, the resulting nativelike 
                  topologies exhibit a coordinate root-mean-square deviation, 
                  cRMSD, from native between 3.1 and 6.7 A. Overall, this 
                  study suggests that the use of restraints derived from 
                  multiple sequence alignments combined with a fold assembly 
                  algorithm is a promising approach to the prediction of the 
                  global topology of small proteins.}

  abstract =	 "Clustering is an important exploratory data analysis
                  task. It aims to find the intrinsic structure of
                  data by organizing data objects into similarity
                  groups or clusters. It is often called unsupervised
                  learning because no class labels denoting an a
                  priori partition of the objects are given. This is
                  in contrast with supervised learning (e.g.,
                  classification) for which the data objects are
                  already labeled with known classes. Past research in
                  clustering has produced many algorithms. However,
                  these algorithms have some major shortcomings. In
                  this paper, we propose a novel clustering technique,
                  which is based on a supervised learning technique
                  called decision tree construction. The new technique
                  is able to overcome many of these shortcomings. The
                  key idea is to use a decision tree to partition the
                  data space into cluster and empty (sparse) regions
                  at different levels of details. We achieve this by
                  introducing virtual data points into the space and
                  then applying a modified decision tree algorithm for
                  the purpose. The technique is able to find natural
                  or true clusters in large high dimensional spaces
                  efficiently. It is suitable for clustering in the
                  full dimensional space as well as in subspaces. It
                  also provides easily comprehensible descriptions of
                  the resulting clusters. Experiments on both
                  synthetic data and real-life data show that the
                  technique is very effective and also scales well for
                  large high dimensional datasets.",

                  on sequence information only has been emphasized in view of 
                  the fast accumulation of new genes in the databases. While 
                  most predictive algorithms are based on multiple alignments 
                  of already known binding sites, here we examine the 
                  usefulness of a novel approach that is based on structural 
                  information of the protein-DNA complex. It has already been 
                  shown that specific recognition between a protein and its 
                  DNA target is achieved by stereo-chemical complementarity 
                  between the protein amino acids and the DNA bases. The 
                  proposed computational scheme uses crystallographic 
                  information to define the set of amino acid-base contacts 
                  between the proteins of a given DNA-binding protein family 
                  and their DNA targets. The compatibility of a given protein 
                  to bind to putative regulatory DNA sequences is then 
                  evaluated by knowledge-based parameters for amino acid-base 
                  interactions. By this procedure gene upstream regions may be 
                  screened for potential binding sites for regulatory 
                  proteins. Predictions are demonstrated for the E. coli 
                  cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) which recognizes the DNA 
                  via the helix-turn-helix motif, and for various Zif268-like 
                  proteins which belong to the Cys2His2 zinc finger family. 
                  The advantages and limitations of this approach are

complex structures. The surfaces of the polyhedra in the simulation are covered with bonding sites in states akin to those of
cellular automata. The bonding sites interact with sites on neighbouring polyhedra to apply forces of attraction and repulsion
between bodies and to trigger transitions in their states. Using only these mechanisms, the elements exhibit chaining, membrane
and cluster formation, and differentiation / segregation. Examples of each of these phenomena are given along with explanations
as to how they are formed. Assembly without the guidance of an external agent or central control is in-frequently used in the
construction of complex artificial structures, but is the norm for biological construction. This paper presents a model by which the
construction of complex structures may be simulated using multiple reactive, artificial agents, acting independently under artificial
physical and chemical laws. }

  abstract =	 {Distinct RNA structures are frequently involved in a
                  widerange of functions in various biological
                  mechanisms. The three dimensional RNA structures
                  solved by X-ray crystallography and various
                  well-established RNA phylogenetic structures indicate
                  that functional RNAs have characteristic RNA
                  structural motifs represented by specific combinations
                  of base pairings and conserved nucleotides in the loop
                  region. Discovery of well-ordered RNA structures and
                  their homologues in genome-wide searches will enhance
                  our ability to detect the RNA structural motifs and
                  help us to highlight their association with functional
                  and regulatory RNA elements. We present here a novel
                  computer algorithm, HomoStRscan, that takes a single
                  RNA sequence with its secondary structure to search
                  for homologous RNAs in complete genomes. This novel
                  algorithm completely differs from other currently used
                  search algorithms of homologous structures or
                  structural motifs. For an arbitrary segment (or
                  window) given in the target sequence, that has similar
                  size to the query sequence, HomoStRscan finds the most
                  similar structure to the input query structure and
                  computes the maximal similarity score (MSS) between
                  the two structures. The homologous RNA structures are
                  then statistically inferred from the MSS distribution
                  computed in the target genome. The method provides a
                  flexible, robust and fine search tool for any
                  homologous structural RNAs.}

                  of uncertainty directly through their representational 
                  framework and their theory for data combination. In this 
                  paper, we discuss the advantages of probabilistic 
                  formulations for molecular-structure calculations, describe 
                  one implementation of such a formulation, and show its 
                  performance on a data set derived from analysis of the 
                  statistical correlations within a set of aligned transfer 
                  RNA sequences. By assigning reasonable physical 
                  interpretations to certain statistical correlations, we are 
                  able to calculate three-dimensional structures for tRNA from 
                  a random starting structure. The constraints that we use are 
                  associated with different variances, and so their effects 
                  are not uniform, and must be reconciled by a probabilistic 
                  algorithm to yield the most likely structure. As might be 
                  predicted, the uncertainty in the position for each base is 
                  a function of both the number and strength of the 
                  constraints, and is reflected in the variances in atomic 
                  position calculated by the algorithm. For example, the hinge 
                  region in the tRNA is shown to be the most uncertain. In 
                  addition, the algorithm retains information about positional 
                  covariation that is useful for understanding the 
                  relationships between different parts of the structure. 
                  These experiments also demonstrate that we can define a 
                  single-sphere representation for each base that is useful 
                  for nucleic acid structural calculations in the same way 
                  that alpha-carbon representations are useful for protein 
                  structural calculations.}

			 promoter region, and the prediction of mRNA expression from combinations 
			 of gene regulation events in different settings. Our approach has several 
			 advantages. By learning promoter sequence motifs that are directly predictive 
			 of expression data, it can improve the identification of binding site patterns.
			  It is also able to identify
 			 combinatorial regulation via interactions of different transcription factors. 
			 Finally, the general framework allows us to integrate additional data sources, 
			 including data from the recent binding localization assays. 
			 We demonstrate our approach on the cell cycle data of Spellman et al., 
			 combined with the binding localization information of Simon et al. 
			 We show that the learned model predicts expression from sequence, and that 
			 it identifies coherent co-regulated groups with significant transcription factor 
			 motifs. It also provides valuable biological insight into the domain via these 
			 co-regulated ``modules'' and the combinatorial regulation effects that govern 
			 their behavior.

ideas behind them, list their advantages and limitations, and compare
their pruning power. Then we briefly explain how these techniques can be

Abstract = {Many classes of reasoning problems display a
large amount of symmetry. In mathematical
and common-sense reasoning, such symmetries
are often used to reduce the difficulty of reasoning.
In this paper we show how symmetries can
be used in automated reasoning both to reduce
or avoid case analysis, and to reduce the scope
of existential quantification. We show further
that the computational complexity of the symmetry
detection problem is equivalent (within
a polynomial factor) to that of the graph isomorphism
problem. This result is significant
because the complexity of the graph isomorphism
problem is a hard open problem (it is
believed to lie between P and NP). Further,
for graphs with bounded degree, graph isomorphism
is known to be polynomial decidable. We
then show how P'olya's theorem can be used to
count the number of interpretations of a logical
theory which are ...}}

In this approach, the prior distribution of the parameters of a probability model is formulated from a small amount of tagged data via a stochastic inferencing process and expressed in terms of pseudo-counts. These pseudo-counts together with the counts in the untagged data form the posterior distribution which is used to estimate the model parameters via the EM algorithm. This procedure is used to develop classifiers for three different data sets. In all data sets, the average performance of classifiers developed using priors is superior to the performance of comparable classifiers developed without using priors.

  abstract =    {Selenocysteine (Sec) is a recently discovered 21st amino acid.
  Selenocysteine is encoded by the nucleotide triplet UGA, which is
  usually interpreted as a STOP signal. The insertion of
  selenocysteine requires an additional signal in form of a
  SECIS-element (\textbf{Se}leno\textbf{c}ysteine \textbf{I}nsertion
  \textbf{S}equence). This is an mRNA-motif, which is defined by both
  sequence-related and structure-related properties.

  The bioinformatics problem of interest is to design new selenoproteins
  (i.e., proteins containing  selenocysteine), since seleno variants of
  proteins are very useful in structure analysis. When designing
  new bacterial selenoproteins, one encounters the problem that 
  the SECIS-element itself is translated (and therefore encodes a
  subsequence of the complete protein). Hence, changes on the
  level of mRNA made in order to 
  generate a SECIS-element will also modify the amino acid
  sequence. Thus, one searches for an mRNA that is maximally similar to a
  SECIS-element, and for which the encoded amino acid sequence is
  maximally similar to the original amino acid sequence. In addition, it
  must satisfy the  constraints imposed by the structure. 

  Though the problem is NP-complete if arbitrary structural constraints are
  allowed, it can be solved efficiently when we consider the structures
  as used in SECIS-elements. The remaining 
  problem is to generate a description of the
  SECIS-element (and its diversity) based on the 
  available data.}

  abstract =     {Bayesian networks provide a language for qualitatively representing the conditional independence properties of a distribution. This allows a natural and compact representation of the distribution, eases knowledge acquisition, and supports effective inference algorithms. It is well-known, however, that there are certain independencies that we cannot capture qualitatively within the Bayesian network structure: independencies that hold only in certain contexts, i.e., given a specific assignment of values to certain variables. In this paper, we propose a formal notion of context-specific independence, based on regularities in the conditional probability tables (CPTs) at a node. We present a technique, analogous to (and based on) d-separation, for determining when such an independence holds in a given network. We then focus on one particular qualitative representation scheme --- tree-structured CPTs --- for capturing context-based irrelevance. We suggest ways in which this representation can be used to support effective inference algorithms, both exact and approximate. In particular, we present a structural decomposition of the resulting network which can improve the performance of clustering algorithms, and an alternative algorithm based on cutset conditioning. We also show how the ideas of context-specific independence can be used to support approximate probabilistic inference.}

                  promoter sequences are still unknown. Since experimental 
                  analysis trails behind sequencing, genome-wide computational 
                  promoter discovery is often the only realistic way to 
                  discover these sequences in newly sequenced bacterial 
                  genomes. However, genome-wide samples for promoter discovery 
                  may be very large and corrupted complicating promoter 
                  discovery. We discuss three aspects of genome-wide promoter 
                  discovery: sample generation, signal finding algorithms, and 
                  scoring signals. We applied our new MITRA algorithm to 
                  analyze samples of divergent and convergent genes in 20 
                  bacterial genomes and found strong putative dyad signals in 
                  17 out of the 20 genomes. Moreover, in 12 out of 20 genomes 
                  the found signals are identical or similar to the known 
                  regulatory patterns (Pribnow-Gilbert boxes and CRP binding 
                  sites). Since many of putative signals correspond to 
                  previously known elements of bacterial transcriptional 
                  regulation, the remaining discovered signals are good 
                  candidates for unknown regulatory elements.}

  abstract = {When not enough time is available to fully explorea search
tree, different algorithms will visit different leaves. Depth-first
search and depth-boundeddiscrepancy search, for example, make
opposite assumptions about the distribution of good
leaves.Unfortunately, it is rarely clear a priori which algorithm
will be most appropriate for a particularproblem. Rather than fixing
strong assumptions in advance, we propose an approach in which an
al-gorithm attempts to adjust to the distribution of leaf costs in
the tree while exploring it. By sacrificingcompleteness, such
flexible algorithms can exploit information gathered during the
search using onlyweak assumptions. As an example, we show how a
simple depth-based additive cost model of the treecan be learned
on-line. Empirical analysis using a generic tree search problem shows
that adaptiveprobing is competitive with systematic algorithms on a
variety of hard trees and outperforms themwhen the node-ordering
heuristic makes many mistakes. Results on boolean satisfiability and
two dif-ferent representations of number partitioning confirm these
observations. Adaptive probing com-bines the flexibility and
robustness of local search with the ability to take advantage of
constructiveheuristics.},

    Combining Sequence and Structure in a Map of the Protein Space},

  abstract={We analyze all known protein sequences in search for a
  global map of protein space that is consistent in terms of both
  sequence and structure. Our goal is to define clusters of homologous
  protein domains, beyond those detected by sequence-based methods
  alone, and then to build a three-dimensional (3D) model for each of
  the sequences that are homologous to sequences of known 3D
  structure. This analysis uses both sequence and structure based
  metrics in the analysis of all protein se- quences in a non-redundant
  (NR) database, comprising all major sequence databases.

The analysis starts from the sequences of the SCOP database domains,
which have known three-dimensional structures. These sequences are
clustered first into fam- ilies based on sequence similarity alone,
without incor- porating any information from the SCOP
classification. Each sequence-based family is represented by a profile,
and this profile is used to search the NR database, using
PSI-BLAST. Since PSI-BLAST can lead to false simi- larities, several
different indices of validity are used to control the procedure. Each of
the detected sequences is marked and a profile is built for the whole
cluster of similar sequences. A 3D model is then built for each sequence
in the cluster using an alignment made using the profile as well as the
known structures of the SCOP representatives in the cluster. Clusters
based on SCOP domains are called type-I clusters. In all we find 1421
type-I clusters with total of 168,431 sequences (44.5% of our NR
database).

After all members of type-I clusters have been marked, we analyze the
remaining sequences. The PSI-BLAST procedure is applied repeatedly, each
time with a differ- ent query, to search what is left over from the
previous run. This give type-II clusters, which may overlap.

Type-I and type-II clusters are then grouped using higher level measures of similarity. Those pairs of clus- ters that contain the same common protein (significant overlap in membership), are marked first. The pairs of clusters are then compared using either a structure metric (when 3D structures are known) or a novel se- quence profile metric, and clustered into superfamilies and "fold" families.

This analysis avoids the limitation of classifications that are based
just on sequence comparison, and allows us to construct a 3D model for a
substantial portion of the sequences in the NR database.},

                  possible ways of prebiotic evolution. We propose an 
                  algorithm providing sequences of model proteins with rapid 
                  folding into a given native conformation. Thermodynamical 
                  analysis shows that the increase in speed is matched by an 
                  increase in stability: the evolved sequences are much more 
                  stable in their native conformation than the initial random 
                  sequence. We discuss a possible origin of the first 
                  biopolymers, having stable unique structure. We suggest that 
                  at the prebiotic stage of evolution, long organic polymers 
                  had to be compact in order to avoid hydrolysis and had to be 
                  soluble and thus must not be exceedingly hydrophobic. We 
                  present an algorithm that generates such sequences of model 
                  proteins. The evolved sequences turn out to have a stable 
                  unique structure, into which they quickly fold. This result 
                  illustrates the idea that the unique three-dimensional 
                  native structure of first biopolymers could have evolved as 
                  a side effect of a nonspecific physico-chemical factors 
                  acting at the prebiotic stage of evolution.}

It is time consuming. However, promoters themselves conserve signs of such interaction. Each binding site will be position specific if we assume chemi- cal interaction. Such traces can thus be stochastically extracted by aligning many promoters. Our new method, named POSTSCRIPTER, automatically identifies position specificity of each factor binding site, and also calculates their cooccurency for significance measuring. Applying these to 237 promoters, we extracted novel coincident patterns. They suggest unseen interaction, which we will discuss.}

                  fitness function for evaluating the surface matching
                  of a given conformation. The fitness function is
                  defined as the weighted sum of two contact measures
                  the geometric contact measure and the chemical
                  contact measure. The geometric contact measure
                  measures the "size" of the contact area of two
                  molecules. It is a potential function that counts
                  the "van der Waals contacts" between the atoms of
                  the two molecules (the algorithm does not compute
                  the Lennard-Jones potential). The chemical contact
                  measure is also based on the "van der Waals
                  contacts" principle: We consider all atom pairs that
                  have a "van der Waals" contact, but instead of
                  adding a constant for each pair (a; b) we add a
                  "chemical weight" that depends on the atom pair (a;
                  b). We tested our docking algorithm with a test set
                  that contains the test examples of Norel et
                  al. [NLWN94] and Fischer et al. [FLWN95] and
                  compared the results of our docking algorithm with

                  the results of Fischer et al. [FLWN95] and with the
                  results of Meyer and Schomburg [MS96]. In 32 of 35
                  test examples the best conformation with respect to
                  the fitness function was an approximation of the
                  real conformation.}

                 particular, boosting methods such as AdaBoost have
                 shown good performance applied to real text data.
                 However, most of existing boosting algorithms are based
                 on classifiers that use binary-valued features. Thus,
                 they do not fully make use of the weight information

                 text filtering that uses naive Bayes classifiers as a

                 boosting algorithm to utilize term frequency

  achieving a systems-level understanding of biological systems.
  While current genome projects provide a huge amount of data on genes
  or proteins, lots of research is still necessary to understand how
  the different parts of a biological system interact in order to
  perform complex biological functions. Computational models that
  help to analyze, explain or predict the behavior of biological
  systems play a crucial role in systems biology. The goal of this
  paper is to show that hybrid concurrent constraint programming [11]
  may be a promising alternative to existing modeling approaches in
  systems biology. Hybrid cc is a declarative compositional
  programming language with a well-defined semantics. It allows one to
  model and simulate the dynamics of hybrid systems, which exhibit
  both discrete and continuous change. We show that Hybrid cc can be
  used naturally to model a variety of biological phenomena, such as
  reaching thresholds, kinetics, gene interaction or biological
  pathways.}

                  (1995) and extend it to calculate local forest
                  alignments, which is essential for finding local
                  similar regions in RNA secondary structures. The
                  time complexity of our algorithm is O( | F1| . |F2|
                  . deg(F1) . deg(F2) . (deg(F1) +deg(F2))) where |Fi|
                  is the number of nodes in forest Fi and deg(Fi) is

                  facilitated by a new visualization technique for RNA
                  secondary structure alignments. Finally, we show how
                  potential regulatory motifs can be discovered solely
                  by their structural preservation, and independent of

  abstract = {A central task in the study of evolution is the
      reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from sequences of current-day
      taxa. A well supported approach to tree reconstruction performs
      maximum likelihood (ML) analysis. Unfortunately, searching for the
      maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is computationally
      expensive. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that uses
      Structural-EM for learning maximum likelihood trees. This algorithm
      is similar to the standard EM method for estimating branch lengths,
      except that during iterations of this algorithms the topology is
      improved as well as the branch length. The algorithm performs
      iterations of two steps. In the E-Step, we use the current tree
      topology and branch lengths to compute expected sufficient
      statistics, which summarize the data. In the M-Step, we search for a
      topology that maximizes the likelihood with respect to these
      expected sufficient statistics. As we show, searching for better
      topologies inside the M-step can be done efficiently, as opposed to
      standard search over topologies. We prove that each iteration of
      this procedure increases the likelihood of the topology, and thus
      the procedure must converge. We evaluate our new algorithm on both
      synthetic and real sequence data, and show that it is both
      dramatically faster and finds more plausible trees than standard
      search for maximum likelihood phylogenies.},

  title =	 {Multiple Local Sequence Structure Alignment of RNA
                  Sequences},
  abstract =	 {We present a new method that finds and aligns local
                  sequence structure segments in a set of unaligned
                  RNA sequences of unknown structures. Secondary
                  structural features of RNA sequences are detected
                  given a structural hint, e.g. a stem loop. They form
                  the basis of assigning RNA sequences to their final
                  local sequence structure segments. These segments
                  are characterized by highly probable occurrences
                  combined with high sequence structure similarities
                  among them. Multiple alignment of these regions is
                  done by the program T-Coffee. There are a lot of
                  multiple sequence alignment programs which consider
                  and handle primary sequences quite well. But they
                  lack of finding and aligning structural features of
                  RNA sequences. RNA sequences are often more
                  conserved in their secondary structure than in their
                  primary sequence. Sankoff was one of the first who
                  proposed a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns
                  a set of RNA sequences while predicting their common
                  structures. The most promising approach is the use
                  of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG), which
                  perform global alignments and find a covariance
                  model. Covariance models work well in finding common
                  structural constraints of whole RNA sequences but
                  are not intended to find common local structure
                  properties. FOLDALIGN from G.D. Stormo is a program
                  which considers sequence and structure motifs using
                  nucleotide similarities and basepair maximization.},

                  site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to 
                  assign objective boundaries between these three regions. 
                  Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three 
                  regions are significantly different from expectations. For 
                  instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 
                  12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides.

                  between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but 
                  this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model

Previous work has shown how special purpose algorithms can make use

predicates to the theory. Our approach can be used on any
propositional satisfiability problem, and can be used as a
pre-processor to any (systematic or non-systematic) reasoning method.
In the general case adding symmetry-breaking axioms appears to be
intractable. We discuss methods for generating partial
symmetrybreaking predicates, and show that in several specific cases
symmetries can be broken either fully are partially using a
polynomial number of predicates. These ideas have been implemented
and we include experimental results on two classes of
constraint-satisfaction problems.}

                  essential considering the large volume of the data. Several 
                  techniques based on sequence similarity. Neural Networks, 
                  SVMs, etc have been applied. This paper presents a framework 
                  using the Tree-Augmented Networks (TAN) based on the theory 
                  of learning Bayesian networks but with less restrictive 
                  assumptions than the naive Bayesian networks. In order to 
                  enhance TAN's performance, pre-processing of data is done by 
                  feature discretization and post-processing is done by using 
                  Mean Probability Voting (MPV) scheme. The advantage of using 
                  Bayesian approach over other learning methods is that the 
                  network structure is intuitive. In addition, one can read 
                  off the TAN structure probabilities to determine the 
                  significance of each feature (say, Hydrophobicity) for each 
                  class, which help to further understand the mystery of 
                  protein structure. Experimental results and comparison with 
                  other works over two databases show the effectiveness of our

<P>
 We show how some minor extensions to the feature formalism allow for a
 syntactic description of individual concepts in terms of typed feature structures.  Namely, we propose to include intervals and a special
 kind of sets.  Partial consistency checks can be made on these concept descriptions during the unification of feature terms.  Type checki
ng on these special types involves calling the classifier of the terminological language.  The final consistency check is performed only w
hen transferring these concept descriptions into structures of the A-Box of the terminological language.

most exciting recent developments in Biology. Yet, many more remain
undiscovered. It has been hypothesized that there is in fact an
abundance of functional non-coding RNA (ncRNA) with various catalytic
and regulatory functions. Computational methods tailored specifically
for ncRNA are being actively developed. As the inherent signal for
ncRNA is weaker than that for protein coding genes, comparative
methods offer the most promising approach, and are the subject of our
research. We consider the following problem: Given an RNA sequence
with a known secondary structure, efficiently compute all structural
homologs (computed as a function of sequence and structural
similarity) in a genomic database. Our approach, based on structural
filters that eliminate a large portion of the database, while
retaining the true homologs allows us to search a typical bacterial
database in minutes on a standard PC, with high sensitivity and
specificity. This is two orders of magnitude better than current
available software for the problem.

                  phase with a much higher stability. Lastly we

    (Connected, Undirected, Acyclic graphs with nodes being
    Labeled). This problem is motivated by the study of information
    retrieval for bio-chemical and molecular databases. Suppose we
    define the distance between two CUAL graphs G1 and G2 to be the
    weighted number of edit operations (insert node, delete node and
    relabel node) to transform G1 to G2. By reduction from exact cover
    by 3-sets, one can show that finding the distance between two CUAL
    graphs is NP-complete. In view of the hardness of the problem, we
    propose a constrained distance metric, called the degree-2
    distance, by requiring that any node to be inserted (deleted) have
    no more than 2 neighbors. With this metric, we present an
    efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm runs in
    time O(N1N2D2) for general weighting edit operations and in time
    O(N1N2DpD log D) for integral weighting edit operations, where Ni,
    i = 1; 2, is the number of nodes in Gi, D = minfd1; d2g and di is
    the maximum degree of Gi."

        the heuristics often lead directly to a solution -- but not
        always. Limited discrepancy search addresses the problem of
        what to do when the heuristics fail.

        Our intuition is that a failing heuristic might well have
        succeeded if it were n ot for a small number of "wrong turns"
        along the way. For a binary tree of heigh t d, there are only
        d ways the heuristic could make a single wrong turn, and only
        d(d\Gamma 1) 2 ways it could make two. A small number of wrong
        turns can be overcome by systematically searching all path s
        that differ from the heuristic path in at most a small number
        of decision points, or "discrepancies." Limited discrepancy
        search is a backtracking algorithm that searches the nodes of

                  space-filling irregular tetrahedra, or Delaunay

    average time complexity. In problems with many solutions, where
    the size of the constraints is large, these drawbacksbecome so
    important that users often replace AC-4 by AC-3 [7], a nonoptimal

    keeps the optimal worst-case time complexity of AC-4 while working
    out the drawback of space complexity. More, the average
    time complexity of AC-6 is optimal for constraint networks where
    nothing is known about the semantic of the constraints. At the end

Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example

Unlike conventional RGB color space, it allows the acquisition of large number of spectral bands within the visible spectrum. This results in a feature vector of size greater than 100. For such high dimensionality problems, pattern recognition techniques suffer from the well-known curse-of-dimensionality problem. The two well known techniques to solve this problem are feature extraction and feature selection. In this paper, a feature selection technique using tabu search with an intermediate-term memory is proposed. The cost of a feature subset is measured by leave-one-out correct-classification rate of a Nearest-Neighbor (1-NN) classifier. Experiments have been carried out on textured multispectral images taken at 16 spectral channels and the results have been compared with a reported classical feature extraction technique.},

                  aligning protein sequences and structures in a unified 
                  manner. Recursive dynamic programming (RDP) is a 
                  hierarchical method which, on each level of the hierarchy, 
                  identifies locally optimal solutions and assembles them into 
                  partial alignments of sequences and/or structures. In 
                  contrast to classical dynamic programming, RDP can also 
                  handle alignment problems that use objective functions not 
                  obeying the principle of prefix optimality, e.g. scoring 
                  schemes derived from energy potentials of mean force. For 
                  such alignment problems, RDP aims at computing solutions 
                  that are near-optimal with respect to the involved cost 
                  function and biologically meaningful at the same time. 
                  Towards this goal, RDP maintains a dynamic balance between 
                  different factors governing alignment fitness such as 
                  evolutionary relationships and structural preferences. As in 
                  the RDP method gaps are not scored explicitly, the 
                  problematic assignment of gap cost parameters is 
                  circumvented. In order to evaluate the RDP approach we 
                  analyse whether known and accepted multiple alignments based 
                  on structural information can be reproduced with the RDP 
                  method. For this purpose, we consider the family of 
                  ferredoxins as our prime example. Our experiments show that, 
                  if properly tuned, the RDP method can outperform methods 
                  based on classical sequence alignment algorithms as well as 
                  methods that take purely structural information into 
                  account.}

                  emergent computational strategies for performing a task. In
                  particular, we develop a class of embedded-particle models
                  to describe the computational strategies implemented by
                  particular CAs. To do this, we use the computational
                  mechanics framework of Crutchfield and Hanson, in which a
                  CA's information processing is described in terms of regular
                  domains, embedded particles, and their interactions. We then
                  evaluate this class of models by comparing their
                  computational performance to that of the CAs they model. The
                  results demonstrate, via a generally close quantitative
                  agreement between the CAs and the embedded particle models,
                  that this new model class captures the significant
                  functional features in the CAs' space-time behavior that
                  underlie the CAs' computational capability and evolutionary
                  fitness.},

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the quality of feature subsets generated by the various algorithms, and also compare their computational requirements. Our results show that the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) algorithm, proposed by Pudil et al. (1994), dominates the other algorithms tested. This paper also illustrates the dangers of using feature selection in small sample size situations. It gives the results of applying feature selection to land use classification of SAR satellite images using four different texture models. Pooling features derived from different texture models, followed by a feature selection results in a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy. Application of feature selection to classification of handprinted characters illustrates the value of feature selection in reducing the number of features needed for classifier design},

                  sequence structure segments in a set of unaligned
                  RNA sequences of unknown structures. Recognizing
                  secondary structural features allows us to find
                  highly probable sequence structure segments with
                  high similarities among them. There are a lot of
                  multiple sequence programs which consider and handle
                  primary sequences quite well. But they lack of
                  finding and aligning structural features of RNA
                  sequences. RNA sequences are often more conserved in
                  their secondary structure than in their primary
                  sequence. Sankoff was one of the first who proposed
                  a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns a set of
                  RNA sequences while predicting their common
                  structures. The most promising approach is the use
                  of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG), which
                  perform global alignments and find a covariance
                  model. Covariance models work well in finding common
                  structural constraints of whole RNA sequences but
                  are not intended to find common local structure
                  constraints. FOLDALIGN from G.D. Stormo is a program
                  which considers sequence and structure motifs using

abstract=	{This paper presents a machine learning method to predict polyadenylation signals (PASes) in human DNA and mRNA sequences by analysing features around them. This method consists of three sequential steps of feature manipulation: generation, selection and integration of features. In the first step, new features are generated using k-gram nucleotide acid or amino acid patterns. In the second step, a number of important features are selected by an entropy-based algorithm. In the third step, support vector machines are employed to recognize true PASes from a large number of candidates. Our study shows that true PASes in DNA and mRNA sequences can be characterized by different features, and also shows that both upstream and downstream sequence elements are important for recognizing PASes from DNA sequences. We tested our method on several public data sets as well as our own extracted data sets. In most cases, we achieved better validation results than those reported previously on the same data sets. The important motifs observed are highly consistent with those reported in literature.

                  capable of finding native conformations for

                  calculating maximally compact sets of points
                  (hydrophobic cores), and then threading the given

                  promoters. We perform this analysis with special emphasis on 
                  the fact that promoters are divided into a number of 
                  different classes, depending on which polymerase-associated 
                  factors that bind to them. We find that HMMs trained on such 
                  subclasses of Escherichia coli promoters (specifically, the 
                  so-called sigma 70 and sigma 54 classes) give an excellent 
                  classification of unknown promoters with respect to 
                  sigma-class. HMMs trained on eukaryotic sequences from human 
                  genes also model nicely all the essential well known 
                  signals, in addition to a potentially new signal upstream of 
                  the TATA-box. We furthermore employ a novel technique for 
                  automatically discovering different classes in the input 
                  data (the promoters) using a system of self-organizing 
                  parallel HMMs. These self-organizing HMMs have at the same 
                  time the ability to find clusters and the ability to model 
                  the sequential structure in the input data. This is highly 
                  relevant in situations where the variance in the data is 
                  high, as is the case for the subclass structure in for 
                  example promoter sequences.}

                  Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) provides the 
                  framework for describing the grammar of a legal parse of a 
                  DNA sequence (Stormo & Haussler 1994). Probabilities are 
                  assigned to transitions between states in the GHMM and to 
                  the generation of each nucleotide base given a particular 
                  state. Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize 
                  these probabilities using a standardized training set. Given 
                  a new candidate sequence, the best parse is deduced from the 
                  model using a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the 
                  path through the model with maximum probability. The GHMM is 
                  flexible and modular, so new sensors and additional states 
                  can be inserted easily. In addition, it provides simple 
                  solutions for integrating cardinality constraints, reading 
                  frame constraints, "indels", and homology searching. The 
                  description and results of an implementation of such a 
                  gene-finding model, called Genie, is presented. The exon 
                  sensor is a codon frequency model conditioned on windowed 
                  nucleotide frequency and the preceding codon. Two neural 
                  networks are used, as in (Brunak, Engelbrecht, & Knudsen 
                  1991), for splice site prediction. We show that this simple 
                  model performs quite well. For a cross-validated standard

    We consider the problem of parsing a sequence
into different classes of subsequences. Two common
examples are finding the exons and introns
in genomic sequences and identifying the secondary
structure domains of protein sequences.
In each case there are various types of evidence
that are relevant to the classification, but
none are completely reliable, so we expect some
weighted average of all the evidence to provide
improved classifications. For example, in the
problem of identifying coding regions in genomic
DNA, the combined use of evidence such as codon
bias and splice junction patterns can give more
reliable predictions than either type of evidence
alone.
We show three main results:
1. For a given weighting of the evidence a dynamic
programming algorithm returns the optimal
parse and any number of sub-optimal
parses.
2. For a given weighting of the evidence a dynamic
programming algorithm determines the probability
of the optimal parse and any number of
sub-optimal parses under a ...

    A constraint satisfaction problem involves finding values for
variables subject to constraints on which combinations of values are
allowed.
In some cases it may be impossible or impractical to solve these
problems completely. We may seek to partially solve the problem, in
particular
by satisfying a maximal number of constraints. Standard backtracking
and local consistency techniques for solving constraint satisfaction
problems can be adapted to cope with, and take advantage of, the
differences between partial and complete constraint satisfaction.
Extensive
experimentation on maximal satisfaction problems illuminates the
relative and absolute effectiveness of these methods. A general model
of
partial constraint satisfaction is proposed.

                  at most k edges. We develop an O(k 2 mn + f(k))
                  algorithm for this problem on a graph with n vertices
                  and m edges. In particular, this implies that the

                  molecular biology, asks if a graph can be made proper

  abstract =	 {Like other fields of life sciences, bioinformatics has
turned to capture biological phenomena through probabilistic models,
and to analyse these models using statistical methodology. A central
computational problem in applying useful statistical procedures such
as various hypothesis testing procedures is the computation of
p-values. In this paper, we devise a branch and bound approach to
efficient exact p-value computation, and apply it to a likelihood
ratio test in a frequency table setting. By recursively partitioning
the sample domain and bounding the statistic we avoid the explicit
exhaustive enumeration of all possible outcomes which is currently
carried by the standard statistical packages. The convexity of the
test statistic is further utilized to confer additional speed-up.}

                  binding motif pairs, to describe binding sites. A binding 
                  motif pair consists of two motifs each derived from one side 
                  of the binding protein sequences. The discovery is a 
                  directed approach that uses a combination of two data 
                  sources: 3-D structures of protein complexes and sequences 
                  of interacting proteins. We first extract maximal contact 
                  segment pairs from the protein complexes' structural data. 
                  We then use these segment pairs as templates to sub-group 
                  the interacting protein sequence dataset, and conduct an 
                  iterative refinement to derive significant binding motif 
                  pairs. This combination approach is efficient in handling 
                  large datasets of protein interactions. From a dataset of 
                  78,390 protein interactions, we have discovered 896 
                  significant binding motif pairs. The discovered motif pairs 
                  include many novel motif pairs as well as motifs that agree 
                  well with experimentally validated patterns in the 
                  literature.}

  abstract= {
Recent high-density microarray technologies allow, in principle, the
determination of all k-mers that appear along a DNA sequence, for k = 8 -
10 in a single experiment on a standard chip. The k-mer contents, also
called the spectrum of the sequence, is not sufficient to uniquely
reconstruct a sequence longer than a few hundred bases. We have devised a
polynomial algorithm that reconstructs the sequence, given the spectrum
and a homologous sequence. This situation occurs, for example, in the
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and whenever a
homologue of the target sequence is known. The algorithm is robust, can
handle errors in the spectrum and assumes no knowledge of the k-mer
multiplicities. Our simulations show that with realistic levels of SNPs,
the algorithm correctly reconstructs a target sequence of length up to
2,000 nucleotides when a polymorphic sequence is known. The technique is
generalized to handle profiles and HMMs as input instead of a single
homologous sequence.}

                  formulation introduced by
                  Kececioglu~\cite{Kececioglu91}. We first phrase the
                  problem in terms of forbidden subgraphs, which
                  enables us to express Maximum Trace as an integer
                  linear-programming problem, and then solve the
                  integer linear program using methods from polyhedral
                  combinatorics. The trace {\it polytope\/} is the
                  convex hull of all feasible solutions to the Maximum
                  Trace problem; for the case of two sequences, we
                  give a complete characterization of this
                  polytope. This yields a polynomial-time algorithm
                  for a general version of pairwise sequence alignment
                  that, perhaps suprisingly, does not use dynamic
                  programming; this yields, for instance, a
                  non-dynamic- programming algorithm for sequence
                  comparison under the 0-1 metric, which gives another
                  answer to a long-open question in the area of string
                  algorithms \cite{PW93}. For the multiple-sequence
                  case, we derive several classes of facet-defining
                  inequalities and show that for all but one class,
                  the corresponding separation problem can be solved
                  in polynomial time. This leads to a branch-and-cut
                  algorithm for multiple sequence alignment, and we
                  report on our first computational experience. It
                  appears that a polyhedral approach to multiple
                  sequence alignment can solve instances that are
                  beyond present dynamic-programming approaches. },

                  about protein networks, there is currently no
                  convenient way of sharing and manipulation of such
                  information. We suggest that a formal computer
                  language for describing the biomolecular processes
                  underlying protein networks is essential for rapid
                  advancement in this field. We propose to model
                  biomolecular processes by using the ss-Calculus, a
                  process algebra, originally developed for describing
                  computer processes. Our model for biochemical
                  processes is mathematically well-defined, while
                  remaining biologically faithful and transparent. It
                  is amenable to computer simulation, analysis and
                  formal verification. We have developed a computer
                  simulation system, the PiFCP, for execution and
                  analysis of ss-calculus programs. The system allows
                  us to trace, debug and monitor the behavior of
                  biochemical networks under various manipulations. We
                  present a ss-calculus model for the RTK-MAPK signal
                  transduction pathway, formally represent detailed
                  molecular and biochemical information, and study it

                  techniques which have proven to be very successful for
                  problems involving high-dimensional configuration
                  spaces. Our results applying prm techniques to several
                  small proteins (approximately 60 residues) are very
                  encouraging. The framework enables one to easily and
                  eAEciently compute folding pathways from any denatured
                  starting state to the native fold. This aspect makes
                  our approach ideal for studying global properties of
                  the protein's potential landscape. For example, our
                  results show that folding pathways from different
                  starting denatured states sometimes share some common
                  'gullies', mainly when they are close to the native

                  Carlo methods that they generate Gibbs-Boltzmann
                  distributions, but they are not based on the
                  strategy that this distribution is obtained as
                  stationary state of a suitably constructed Markov

                  various benchmark tests, the resulting algorithms
                  are extremely efficient for lattice models, and are

  abstract = {
In many problems, non-determinism naturally arises in an concurrent
constraint-based formulation in form of disjunctive constraints. To
check consistency of disjunctive constraints, one needs to perform
search by splitting the constraint store into local computation
stores.  An important problem there is to eliminate symmetries, which
give rise to many different but ''similar'' solutions found by the
search procedure.  Since symmetries will give rise to an (often
exponential) amplification of the search space, symmetry exclusion
promises to efficiently prune the search tree.

Hence, many constraint programmers have constructed mechanisms to
exclude at least some of the symmetries of their
problem. Unfortunately, symmetry exclusion was often not
straightforward to implement and had to be redesigned for every
special problem or enumeration strategy, which leaded to an
inflexibility in the program structure once it was introduced. Often
symmetry exclusion was not done at all or only for a small set of
symmetries. In other cases, where symmetry exclusion was implemented
it distracted the programmers attention from more important tasks.

The contribution of our work is to give a generally applicable method
for the exclusion of arbitrary symmetries. To our knowledge, this is
the first general and declarative method for excluding symmetries in
concurrent constraint programming.},

Though the electrostatic, ionic, van der Waals, Lennard-Jones, hydrogen
bonding, and other forces play an important role in the energy function
minimized at a protein's native state, it is widely believed that the {\em
hydrophobic force} is the dominant term in protein folding.  In this paper, we
attempt to quantify the extent to which the hydrophobic force determines the
positions of the backbone $\alpha$-carbon atoms in PDB data, by applying
Monte-Carlo and genetic algorithms to determine the predicted conformation with
minimum energy, where only the hydrophobic force is considered (i.e. Dill's
HP-model, and refinements using Woese's polar requirement).  This is done by
computing the root mean square deviation between the normalized distance matrix
$D = (d_{i,j})$ ($d_{i,j}$ is normalized Euclidean distance between residues
$r_i$ and $r_j$) for PDB data with that obtained from the output of our
algorithms. Our program was run on the database of ancient conserved regions
drawn from GenBank 101 generously supplied by W. Gilbert's lab
\cite{gilbertData,desouzaGilbert}, as well as medium-sized proteins (E. Coli
RecA, {\tt 2reb}, Erythrocruorin, {\tt 1eca}, and Actinidin {\tt 2act}). The
root mean square deviation (RMSD) between distance matrices derived from the
PDB data and from our program output is quite small, and by comparison with
RMSD between PDB data and random coils, allows a quantification of the
hydrophobic force contribution The final version of this paper will appear in
the proceedings of PSB'2000.

                  NP-Complete. Although state-of-the-art SAT solvers
                  can efficiently obtain the solutions of many
                  real-world instances, there are still a large number
                  of real-world SAT families which cannot be solved in
                  reasonable time. Much effort has been spent to take
                  advantage of the internal structure of SAT
                  instances. Existing decomposition techniques are
                  based on preprocessing the static structure of the
                  original problem. We present a dynamic decomposition
                  method based on hypergraph separators. Integrating
                  the separator decomposition into the variable
                  ordering of a modern SAT solver leads to speedups on
                  large real-world satisfiability problems. Compared
                  with a static decomposition based variable ordering,
                  such as Dtree (Huang and Darwiche, 2003), our
                  approach does not need time to construct the full
                  tree decomposition, which sometimes needs more time
                  than the solving process itself. Our primary focus
                  is to achieve speedups on large real-world
                  satisfiability problems. Our results show that the
                  new solver often outperforms both regular zChaff and
                  zChaff integrated with Dtree decomposition. The
                  dynamic separator decomposition shows promise in
                  that it significantly decreases the number of
                  decisions for some real-world problems.},

The structural comparison of proteins has become increasingly important as
a means to identify protein motifs and fold families. In this paper we
present a new algorithm for the comparison of proteins based on a
hierarchy of structural representations, from the secondary structure
level to the atomic level. Our technique represents alpha-helices and
beta-strands as vectors and uses a set of seven scoring functions to
compare pairs of vectors from different proteins. The scores obtained are
used in a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the best local
alignment of the two sets of vectors. The second step in our algorithm is
based on the atomic coordinates of the protein structures and improves the
initial vector alignment by iteratively minimizing the RMSD between pairs
of nearest atoms from the two proteins. We refine the final alignment by
determining a core of well aligned atoms and minimizing the RMSD of this
core. In a comparison of our method to Holm and Sander's DALI algorithm,
our program was able to detect structural similarity at the same level as
DALI. We also performed searches of a representative set of the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) using our program and detected structurally similarity
between several distantly related proteins.}

  abstract = {   This paper argues importance of incorporating morphogenesis phase to 
evolve complex structures, such as
     neural networks, logic circuits, and chemical reaction circuits. In this paper, we propose the incorporation
     of the developmental stage in order to generate a circuit configuration matrix. Using this approach, called
     the grammar encoding method, we evolve a set of rewriting rules, whereas the direct encoding method, a
     conventional approach, evolves the circuit configuration matrix itself. Our approach allows for non-trivial
     mapping of genotype and phenotype, as well as structure operation capability. Experimental results
     demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the direct encoding method. The approach can be
     extended to evolve complex binary decision diagram for general logic circuit design, and to evolve complex
     chemical circuits. (21 References). }

  abstract =	 {CATEGORY: Real-World Applications Structural
                  comparison of proteins is a core problem in modern
                  biomedical research. Identifying structural
                  similarities is essential for the assessment of the
                  relationship between structure and function in
                  proteins, and struc- tural comparison techniques
                  play a key role in applications like rational drug
                  design. In this paper we consider a technique for
                  protein structure comparison known as the maximum
                  contact map overlap problem. In this prob- lem, the
                  similarity between two protein struc- tures is
                  computed by aligning the proteins to maximize the
                  number of shared contacts in their corresponding
                  contact maps. We present a new approach to this
                  problem that uses a Multimeme evolutionary algo-
                  rithm. The best solution found by our algo- rithm
                  provides a lower bound on the value of the optimal
                  structural alignment between the proteins. We have
                  evaluated the Multimeme algorithm on a range of
                  benchmark problems and compared with previous
                  heuristics. We apply a linear programming method,
                  which provides an upper bound, to assess the accu-
                  racy of our solutions. Our experiments show that the
                  Multimeme evolutionary algorithm represents a
                  significant improvement on the current state of the
                  art in metaheuristics for this problem.}

We formally derive a criterion based on the Minimal Description Length principle for choosing the threshold values for the discretization. This new metric embodies a tradeoff between the complexity of the learned discretization, the complexity of the Bayesian network, and the fitness of the network as a model of the training data. This metric has the attractive property of decomposition: the discretization of each variable depends only on the interactions between the variable and its local neighborhood in the network. We examine other properties of this metric that are relevant to the computation of a discretization policy and propose an iterative algorithm for learning a policy. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the discretization in applications to both supervised and unsupervised learning.}

Learning such models is desirable simply because there is a wide array of off-the-shelf tools that can apply the learned models as expert systems, diagnosis engines, and decision support systems. Practitioners also claim that adaptive Bayesian networks have advantages in their own right as a non-parametric method for density estimation, data analysis, pattern classification, and modeling. Among the reasons cited we find: their semantic clarity and understandability by humans, the ease of acquisition and incorporation of prior knowledge, the ease of integration with optimal decision-making methods, the possibility of causal interpretation of learned models, and the automatic handling of noisy and missing data.

In spite of these claims, and the initial success reported recently, methods that learn Bayesian networks have yet to make the impact that other techniques such as neural networks and hidden Markov models have made in applications such as pattern and speech recognition. In this paper, we challenge the research community to identify and characterize domains where induction of Bayesian networks makes the critical difference, and to quantify the factors that are responsible for that difference. In addition to formalizing the challenge, we identify research problems whose solution is, in our view, crucial for meeting this challenge. }

                  Most current solutions suffer from weak specificity. We face this by
                  determining highly predicative sequence-related TFBS  features of miscellaneous types and 
                  by integrating these features in Bayesian networks to consider dependencies among them.

  abstract = {
The protein structure prediction problem is one of the most important
problems in computational biology. This problem consists of finding
the conformation of a protein (given by a sequence of amino-acids)
with minimal energy. Because of the complexity of this problem,
simplified models like Dill's HP-lattice model
have become a major tool for investigating general properties of
protein folding. Even for this simplified model, the structure
prediction problem has been proven to be NP-complete.

A disadvantage of the HP-problem is its high degeneracy. I.e., for
every sequence there are a lot of conformations having the minimal
energy. For this reason, extended alphabets have been used in the
literature. One of these alphabets is the HPNX-alphabet, which
considers hydrophobic amino acids as well as positive and negative
charged ones.

In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for solving the
structure prediction problem for the HPNX-alphabet.  To our knowledge,
our algorithm is the first exact one for finding the minimal
conformation of an lattice protein in a lattice model with an alphabet
more complex than HP.  We also compare our results with results as
given for the HP-model.

A simulated annealing method is described for training hidden Markov
models and producing multiple sequence alignments from initially unaligned
protein or DNA sequences. Simulated annealing in turn uses a dynamic
programming algorithm for correctly sampling suboptimal multiple
alignments according to their probability and a Boltzmann temperature
factor. The quality of simulated annealing alignments is evaluated on
structural alignments of ten different protein families, and compared to
the performance of other HMM training methods and the ClustalW program.
Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the
multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMM
training methods. Neither ClustalW nor simulated annealing produce
consistently better alignments compared to each other. Examination of the
specific cases in which ClustalW outperforms simulated annealing, and vice
versa, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current
hidden Markov model approaches.}

                  alignment are discussed and evaluated. Presented
                  here are two newalgorithms for optimal pairwise
                  sequence alignment which outperform traditional
                  methods on very large problem instances (hundreds of
                  thousands of characters, for example).The technique
                  combines the benefits of dynamic programming and A*
                  heuristic search, with a minimal amount ofadditional
                  overhead. The dynamic programming matrix is
                  traversed along antidiagonals, bounding the
                  computation to exclude portions of the matrix that
                  cannot contain opti-mal paths. An admissible

                  re-quirements are a major concern for large sequence
                  alignment problems, it is shown how the standard
                  algorithm (re-quiring quadratic space) can be
                  reformulated as a divide and conquer algorithm
                  (requiring only linear space, at the cost of some

                  combinatorial optimization problems can cause
                  considerable difficulties for exact solvers. One way
                  to overcome the problem is to employ sophisticated
                  models with no or at least less symmetries. However,
                  this often requires a lot of experience from the
                  user who is carrying out the modeling. Moreover,
                  some problems even contain inherent symmetries that
                  cannot be broken by remodeling. We present an
                  approach that detects symmetries during the
                  search. It enables the user to find solutions for
                  complex problems with minimal effort spent on
                  modeling. <p> Keywords. symmetry breaking during

                  disorder in non-living "protocells". Such
                  chemistries have relevance to origin-of-life studies
                  as well as to artificial life research. We present a
                  model comprised of interacting polymers, and specify
                  two initial conditions: a distribution of relatively
                  disordered polymers and a fixed set of reversible
                  catalytic reactions. A genetic algorithm is then
                  used to find a set of reactions that exhibit a
                  pre-specified behavior. Our results show that
                  reaction sets can be found to give polymer
                  distributions that are biased towards longer
                  polymers. We present examples of these protocell
                  chemistries and show that the reaction sets found
                  are robust in the sense that they produce desirable
                  behavior in equilibrium. Such a technique is useful
                  because it allows an investigator to determine
                  whether a specific distribution can be produced, and
                  if it can, a reaction network can be found and then
                  analyzed. (10 References). }

  abstract =     {In molecular biology and bioinformatics, searching RNA
                  gene occurrences in genomic sequences is a task whose
                  importance has been renewed by the recent discovery of
                  numerous functional RNA, often interacting with other
                  ligands. Even if several programs exist for RNA motif
                  search, no program exists that can represent and solve
                  the problem of searching for occurrences of RNA motifs
                  in interaction with other molecules. In this paper, we
                  present a CSP formulation of this problem. We
                  represent such RNA as structured motifs that occur on
                  more than one sequence and which are related together
                  by possible hybridization. Together with pattern
                  matching algorithms, constraint satisfaction
                  techniques have been implemented in a prototype MilPat
                  and applied to search for tRNA and snoRNA genes on
                  genomic sequences. Results show that these combined
                  techniques allow to efficiently search for interacting
                  motifs in large genomic sequences and offer a simple
                  and extensible framework to solve such problems.},

  abstract =	 {We describe a new algorithm for amino acid sequence 
                  classification and the detection of remote homologues. The 
                  rationale is to exploit both vertical and horizontal 
                  information of a multiple alignment in a well balanced 
                  manner. This is in contrast to established methods like 
                  profiles and hidden Markov models which focus on vertical 
                  information as they model the columns of the alignment 
                  independently. In our setting, we want to select from a 
                  given database of "candidate sequences" those proteins that 
                  belong to a given superfamily. In order to do so, each 
                  candidate sequence is separately tested against a multiple 
                  alignment of the known members of the superfamily by means 
                  of a new jumping alignment algorithm. This algorithm is an 
                  extension of the Smith-Waterman algorithm and computes a 
                  local alignment of a single sequence and a multiple 
                  alignment. In contrast to traditional methods, however, this 
                  alignment is not based on a summary of the individual 
                  columns of the multiple alignment. Rather, the candidate 
                  sequence at each position is aligned to one sequence of the 
                  multiple alignment, called the "reference sequence". In 
                  addition, the reference sequence may change within the 
                  alignment, while each such jump is penalized. To evaluate 
                  the discriminative quality of the jumping alignment 
                  algorithm, we compared it to hidden Markov models on a 
                  subset of the SCOP database of protein domains. The 
                  discriminative quality was assessed by counting the number 
                  of false positives that ranked higher than the first true 
                  positive (FP-count). For moderate FP-counts above five, the 
                  number of successful searches with our method was 
                  considerably higher than with hidden Markov models.}

    We propose a novel algorithm that, given a long DNA sequence, finds
approximate

repeats, allowing general insertions and deletions. The idea is based
on the Gibbs

sampling approach of Lawrence et al. The novelty of our algorithm
stems largely from

our handling of gaps in the motif occurrences. Another contribution
is the use of

relative entropy as a natural scoring function for alignment of the
motif occurrences.

We describe the results of experiments with this algorithm on the
full H. influenzae

genome.

1. Introduction

With large-scale DNA sequencing under way, many of the questions on
the horizon deal
with sequence analysis. Once an organism's genomic DNA is sequenced,
how can we
discover which of its subsequences are functional, and what their
functions are?

For some of these questions, significant progress has already been
made. For instance,
the question of locating the genes has received much attention, and
is well understood in
some instances, particularly in the case o...

                  problem for the comparison of protein structures. The
                  approach is based on formulating the problem as an
                  inte- ger linear program and then relaxing in a
                  Lagrangian way a suitable set of constraints. This
                  relaxation is solved by computing a sequence of simple
                  alignment problems, each in quadratic time, and
                  near-optimal Lagrangian multipliers are found by
                  subgradient optimization. By our approach we achieved
                  a substantial speedup over the best existing
                  methods. We were able to solve optimally for the first
                  time instances for PDB proteins with about 1000
                  residues and 2000 contacts. Moreover, within a few

problem, but, when solving a real puzzle,
the mapping from clues to variable domains is not

be respected along with the constraints of the puzzle.
Motivated by this type of problem, we provide a formal
model of constraint satisfaction with probabilistic
preferences on variable values. Two natural optimization
problems are defined for this model: maximizing
the probability of a correct solution, and maximizing
the number of correct words (variable values) in the
solution. We provide an efficient iterative approximation
for the latter based on dynamic programming and
present very encouraging results on a collection of real
and artificial crossword puzzles.}}

Therefore, we propose a multi-channel signal-like sequence representation based on a combination of several numerically encoded biochemical properties of the individual residues. From this representation features are extracted capturing relevant local sequence properties by applying wavelet and principal component analysis.
Evaluation results on a challenging task of sequence family classification prove that Profile HMMs trained on the feature-based sequence representation significantly outperform discrete models.},

Motivation: Transcription regulation involves binding of transcription factors to sequence-specific sites and controlling the expression of nearby genes. Given binding site models, one can scan the regulatory regions for putative binding sites and construct a genome-wide regulatory network. Several recent works demonstrated the importance of modeling dependencies between positions in the binding site. The challenge is to evaluate the statistical significance of binding sites using these models. Results: We present a general, accurate and efficient method for this task, applicable to any probabilistic binding site and background models. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method on synthetic and real-life data. Availability: The algorithm used to compute the statistical significance of putative binding sites scores is available online at http://compbio.cs.huji.ac.il/CIS/

exact calculations, thus we utilize variational approximations. We
consider three different distributions for the approximation: one in
which the Markov calculations are performed exactly and the layers
of the decision tree are decoupled, one in which the decision tree
calculations are performed exactly and the time steps of the Markov
chain are decoupled, and one in which a Viterbi-like assumption is
made to pick out a single most likely state sequence. We present
simulation results for artificial data and the Bach chorales.

  abstract =	 {The protein structure prediction problem is one of
                  the most studied problems in Computational
                  Biology. It can be reasonably abstracted as a
                  minimization problem. The function to be minimized
                  depends on the distances between the various
                  amino-acids composing the protein and on their
                  types. Even with strong approximations, the problem
                  is shown to be computationally intractable. However,
                  the solution of the problem for an arbitrary input
                  size is not needed. Solutions for proteins of length
                  100-200 would give a strong contribution to
                  Biotechnology. In this paper, we tackle the problem
                  with constraint-based methods, using additional
                  constraints and heuristics coming from the secondary
                  structure of a protein that can be quickly predicted
                  with acceptable approximation. Our prototypic
                  implementation is written using constraints over
                  finite domains in the Mozart programming system. It
                  improves over any previous constraint-based approach
                  and shows the power and flexibility of the
                  method. Especially, it is well suited for further
                  extensions.},

  whether the domain size d is even, in which case the algorithm runs
  in O(1.3247n*(d/2)n time, or odd, in which case it runs in
  O(1.3247n*((d2+d+2)/4)n/2 if d = 4*k+1, and O(1.3247n*((d2+d)/4)n/2

                  structure of base-pairing between A\Gamma U and C
                  \Gamma  G pairs in the string. Edges are drawn between
                  two bases that are paired in the secondary structure
                  and these edges have traditionally been assumed to be
                  noncrossing. The noncrossing base-pairing naturally
                  leads to a tree-like representation of the secondary
                  structure of RNA strings. 

                  In this paper, we address several notions of
                  similarity between two RNA strings that take into
                  account both the primary sequence and secondary
                  base-pairing structure of the strings. We present
                  efficient algorithms for exact matching and
                  approximate matching between two RNA strings. We
                  define a notion of alignment between two RNA strings
                  and devise algo- rithms based on dynamic
                  programming. We then present a method for optimally
                  aligning a given RNA string with unknown secondary
                  structure to one with known sequence and structure,
                  thus attacking the structure prediction problem in the
                  case when the structure of a closely related se-
                  quence is known. The techniques employed to prove our
                  results include reductions to well-known string
                  matching problems allowing wild cards and ranges, and
                  speeding up dynamic programming by using the tree
                  structures implicit in the secondary structure of RNA
                  strings.}

                  algorithm for HP (hydrophobic - polar) type lattice
                  proteins. It is designed after the concept of
                  unguided, cotranslational folding of a nascent
                  peptide. It is deterministic and runs in O(n) in the
                  chain length. Accuracy of prediction is governed by
                  the search depth of the algorithm that is "looked
                  ahead" at each chain growth step. Long range
                  interactions are significantly increased and energy
                  barriers become less prohibitive with increasing
                  search depth. The efficiency of sequential folding
                  is tested and results compared to related
                  methods. All characteristics of the HP-model such as
                  formation of a hydrophobic core and overall compact
                  structures are observed. Since the procedure is very
                  fast and flexible we obtain a useful tool to
                  approximate the sequence to structure mapping of
                  biopolymers in general and to study the complex
                  interplay of folding strategies, potentials and

                  Analysis},

  year =         1999,
  abstract =     {Molecular biologists use algorithms that compare and
                  otherwise analyze sequences that represent genetic and
                  protein molecules. Most of these algorithms, however,
                  operate on the basic sequence and do not incorporate
                  the additional information that is often known about
                  the molecule and its pieces. This research describes
                  schemes to combinatorially annotate this information
                  onto sequences so that it can be analyzed in tandem
                  with the sequence; the overall result would thus
                  reflect both types of information about the
                  sequence. These annotation schemes include adding
                  colours and arcs to the sequence. Colouring a sequence
                  would produce a same-length sequence of colours or
                  other symbols that highlight or label parts of the
                  sequence. Arcs can be used to link sequence symbols
                  (or coloured substrings) to indicate molecular bonds
                  or other relationships. Adding these annotations to
                  sequence analysis problems such as sequence alignment
                  or finding the longest common subsequence can make the
                  problem more complex, often depending on the
                  complexity of the annotation scheme. This research
                  examines the different annotation schemes and the
                  corresponding problems of verifying annotations,
                  creating annotations, and finding the longest common
                  subsequence of pairs of sequences with
                  annotations. This work involves both the conventional
                  complexity framework and parameterized complexity, and
                  includes algorithms and hardness results for both
                  frameworks. Automata and transducers are created for
                  some annotation verification and creation
                  problems. Different restrictions on layered substring
                  and arc annotation are considered to determine what
                  properties an annotation scheme must have to make its
                  incorporation feasible. Extensions to the algorithms
                  that use weighting schemes are explored.}  ,

                  a theoretical and a practical point of view. For the
                  first time in sequence alignment, we use tools from
                  combinatorial optimization to develop branch-and-cut
                  algorithms that solve these problems efficiently. The
                  Generalized Maximum Trace formulation captures several
                  forms of multiple sequence alignment problems in a
                  common framework, among them is the original
                  formulation of Maximum Trace. The Structural Maximum
                  Trace Problem captures the comparison of RNA molecules
                  on the basis of their primary sequence and their
                  secondary structure. For both problems we derive a
                  characterization in terms of graphs which we use to
                  reformulate the problems in terms of integer linear
                  programs. We then study the polytopes (or convex hulls
                  of all feasible solutions) associated with the integer
                  linear program for both problems. For each polytope we
                  derive several classes of facet-defining inequalities
                  and show that for some of these classes the
                  corresponding separation problem can be solved in
                  polynomial time. This leads to a polynomial time
                  algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment that is not
                  based on dynamic programming. Moreover, for multiple
                  sequences the branch-and-cut algorithms for both
                  sequence alignment problems are able to solve to
                  optimality instances that are beyond the range of

  abstract = {This work addresses the question: {W}hat are the basic design considerations
	for creating a synthetic model of the evolution of living systems
	(i.e. an 'artifcial life' system)? {I}t can also be viewed as an
	attempt to elucidate the logical structure (in a very general sense)
	of biological evolution. {H}owever, with no adequate defnition of
	life, the experimental portion of the work concentrates on more specifc
	issues, and primarily on the issue of open-ended evolution. {A}n
	artifcial evolutionary system called {C}osmos, which provides a virtual
	operating system capable of simulating the parallel processing and
	evolution of a population of several thousand self-reproducing computer
	programs, is introduced. {C}osmos is related to {R}ay's established
	{T}ierra system [{R}ay 91], but there are a number of signifcant
	diferences. {A} wide variety of experiments with {C}osmos, which
	were designed to investigate its evolutionary dynamics, are reported.
	{A}n analysis of the results is presented, with particular attention
	given to the role of contingency in determining the outcome of the
	runs. {T}he results of this work, and consideration of the existing
	literature on artifcial evolutionary systems, leads to the conclusion
	that artifcial life models such as this are lacking on a number of
	theoretical and methodological grounds. {I}t is emphasised that explicit
	theoretical considerations shouldguide the design of such models,
	if they are to be of scientifc value. {A}n analysis ofvarious issues
	relating to self-reproduction, especially in the context of evolution,
	is presented, including some extensions to von {N}eumann's analysis
	of self-reproduction [von {N}eumann 66]. {T}his suggests ways in
	which the evolutionary potential of such models might be improved.
	{I}n particular, a shift of focus is recommended towards a more careful
	consideration of the phenotypic capabilities of the reproducing individuals.
	{P}henotypic capabilities fundamentally involve interactions with
	the environment (both abiotic and biotic), and it is further argued
	that the theoretical grounding upon which these models should be
	based must include consideration of the kind of environments and
	the kind of interactions required for open-ended evolution. {A} number
	of useful future research directions are identifed. {F}inally, the
	relevance of such work to the original goal of modelling the evolution
	of living systems (as opposed to the more general goal of modelling
	open-ended evolution) is discussed. {I}t is suggested that the study
	of open-ended evolution can lead us to a better understanding of
	the essential properties of life, but only if the questions being
	asked in these studies are phrased appropriately.},

  abstract =     {Bayesian networks have become a popular probabilistic model for coping with uncertainty. When learning their structure from given data the constraint-based approach has proven to be very efficient in many experiments. However, this approach is only well-understood under certain conditions, typically only when infinite data sets are provided. This thesis focuses on the constraint-based approach for those cases where only a finite amount of data is available, as typical in practical applications. Among various extensions to this approach the so-called necessary path condition is presented. While its use does not notably increase computation time, it entails considerable improvements in the quality of the induced network structures. In particular, uncertainty regarding the presence of edges can be discovered by this extension: instead of a single network structure, as typical for state-of-the-art constraint-based approaches, it can find several graphs. As the induced graphs usually have many common edges and differ only in the presence of a few edges, they can be visualized by means of a single graph, thus easing the interpretation.}

"This thesis studies feature trees as a semantic domain for various 
kinds of feature descriptions used in logic programming and
constraint-based grammar formalisms. We show that feature trees serve as
a canonical model for these descriptions which is mathematically
simpler than the previously used standard interpretation, whose domain
consists of feature graphs. Moreover, feature trees are the natural
interpretation for the description language CFT [Smolka/Treinen94], which
combines the expressivity of feature descriptions with first-order
constructor terms. For this language, feature graphs do not provide the
right semantics. But for the basic feature description language, we show
that feature
trees and feature graphs have exactly the same properties. Thus, feature
trees are suitable to take over the role feature graphs have played so far.

One major subject of this thesis is to investigate the expressivity of
the different description languages under the feature tree
interpretation. We show that the
language F [Treinen93], which allows feature to be
first-class values (i.e., which allows for quantification over
features), is expressive enough to define functional uncertainty
constraints [Kaplan/Maxwell88]. In this language one can even encode
relations that are defined by the least interpretation of 
definite equivalences (under some restriction even those defined by the
greatest interpretation). Prominent members of this class of relations
are the one described by logic programs.  Although a lot of different
feature description languages have been introduced in the literature,
there are only rare cases where the expressivity of these languages have
been studied. Thus, this thesis provides a technical basis for such
kinds of studies.

In the rest of this thesis, we investigate decidable fragments of
these languages. We will show that set of all formulae of the basic
feature description language valid in the feature tree interpretation is
decidable. The same holds for the language CFT. Furthermore, we 
show that satisfiability of positive formulae in the language of
functional uncertainty constraints is decidable. This was stated as an
open problem in [Kaplan/Maxwell88]. In all cases, we will present an
effective decision algorithm.

			 to be ungrammaticalin even the slightest way, such parsers are 
			 unsuitable for parsing spontaneous speech, where completely 
			 grammatical input is the exception more than the rule. 
			 This thesis describes GLR*, a parsing system based on Tomita's 
			 Generalized LR parsing algorithm,that was designed to be robust 
			 to two particular types of extra-grammaticality: noise in the input,
			 and limited grammar coverage. GLR* attempts to overcome these forms 
			 of extra-grammaticalityby ignoring the unparsable words and fragments 
			 and conducting a search for the maximal subset of the original input 
			 that is covered by the grammar. The parser is coupled with a beam 
			 searchheuristic, that limits the combinations of skipped words 
			 considered by the parser, and ensures that the parser will operate 
			 within feasible time and space bounds. The developed parsing system 
			 includes several tools designed to address the difficulties of 
			 parsingspontaneous speech. To cope with high levels of ambiguity, 
			 we developed a statistical disambiguation module, in which probabilities 
			 are attached directly to the actions in the LR parsing table. 
			 The parser must also determine the "best" parse from among the 
			 different parsable subsets of an input. We thus designed a general 
			 framework for combining a collection of parse evaluation measures 
			 into an integrated heuristic for evaluating and ranking the parses 
			 produced by the GLR* parser.This framework was applied to a set of 
			 four parse scoring measures developed for the JANUS
			 scheduling domain and the ATIS domain. We added a parse quality heuristic, 
			 that allows theparser to self-judge the quality of the parse chosen as best, 
			 and to detect cases in which important information is likely to have been 
			 skipped. To demonstrate its suitability to parsing spontaneous speech, 
			 the GLR* parser was integrated into the JANUS speech translation system. 
			 Our evaluations on both transcribed and speech recognizedinput have 
			 indicated that the version of the system that uses GLR* produces between 15% and 30%
			 more acceptable translations, than a corresponding version that uses the original 
			 non-robust GLRparser. We also developed a version of GLR* that is suitable 
			 to parsing word lattices produced by the speech recognizer, and investigated 
			 how lattice parsing can potentially overcome errors of the speech recognizer 
			 and further improve end-to-end performance of the speech translation system.

Structural ambiguity in linguistic analyses is a severe problem 
for natural language processing. For grammars describing a nontrivial 
fragment of natural language, every input of reasonable length may 
receive a large number of analyses, many of which are implausible 
or spurious. This problem is even harder for highly complex constraint-based 
grammars. Whereas the mathematical foundation of such grammars as 
instances of constraint logic programming is clear enough, there is 
so far no mathematically well-deo/ned method for extending constraint 
logic programs by using weights to introduce graded distictions between
analyses. Previous approaches to ambiguity resolution for context-dependent
 natural language processing models either are tailored to specio/c 
 applications and based on uncertain mathematical grounds, or they are suOEciently 
 well-deo/ned and expressive but infeasible in practice.

In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and 
algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in constraint-based 
natural language processing. The o/rst approach, called quantitative constraint 
logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical framework, and presents 
a sound and complete system of quantitative inference for deo/nite clauses annotated 
with subjective weights. This approach combines a rigorous formal semantics for 
quantitative inference based on subjective weights with eOEcient weight-based 
pruning for constraint-based systems. The second approach, called probabilistic 
constraint logic programming, introduces a log-linear probability distribution 
on the proof trees of a constraint logic program and an algorithm for statistical 
inference of the parameters and properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., 
unparsed data. The possibility of deo/ning arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties 
of the log-linear probability model and eOEciently estimating appropriate parameter values 
for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary context-dependencies in constraint 
logic programs. The usefulness of these ideas is evaluated empirically in a 
small-scale experiment on o/nding the correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. 
In addition, we address the problem of computational intractability of the calculation 
of expectations in the inference task and present various techniques to approximately 
solve this task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching 
for the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.}}

                  Burkhard Rost & Christian Sander, [RS95]

                  This thesis is a synthesis of the author's work on
                  experimental computational physics studies related to
                  the so called protein folding problem and the related
                  Levinthal's paradox in particular. The problem belongs
                  to the rich set of interesting mesoscopic
                  self-organisation phenomena that still mostly lack
                  rigorous analytical or computational
                  solutions. Several global optimisation algorithmic
                  approaches to solve the protein folding problem in a
                  cubic lattice were implemented and tested. The first
                  approach was to use several simple algorithms to
                  produce more or less random building blocks, which
                  were then joined by stochastic search algorithms into
                  trial conformations. Several optimisation algorithms
                  including local hill climbing schemes were used to aid
                  an otherwise random search. The conformation energy
                  optimisation was done using several population based
                  methods: the most fit conformations of a set of
                  randomly generated trial conformations were
                  re-evaluated by slightly modifying them in a Monte
                  Carlo fashion. Finally the model was extended by a
                  simple implementation of hydration. The main result of
                  the experiments was that the modeling of hydration
                  seem to be a significant factor to solve the
                  Levinthal's paradox. This is due to the energy surface
                  smoothing and longer range interactions caused by
                  hydration. Hydration also brings more specific
                  correlation between free energy and conformational
                  compactness when compare d to the popular lattice
                  models thus aiding conformational search in a way that
                  is not only computationally but also physically
                  sound. Results were compared to those gotten using
                  both the basic local HP model and global Coulombic
                  type models. }

                  simulate evolutionary behaviour in populations of
                  catalytically active RNA molecules. Randomly colliding
                  RNA strings interact by folding into their cofolded
                  secondary struc- ture. This secondary structure is
                  computed using a dynamic programming folding
                  algorithm; if certain predefined structural motifs
                  occur, the sequences are assumed to act as ribozymes
                  catalyzing cleavage or ligation reactions at defined
                  catalytic sites. These reactions lead to the formation
                  of new sequences and are a main source of population
                  diversity. Influences of various boundary conditions,
                  such as conservation of mass dur- ing reactions,
                  preferred replication of reactive sequences, constant
                  organiza- tion and different replication error rates
                  and cleavage criteria, on the emer- gence of
                  quasi-stationary sequence distributions are
                  analyzed. The resilience of such quasi-stationary
                  distributions, where all sequences in the population
                  are produced by a network of catalytic interactions
                  between members of the population, against changes of
                  boundary conditions is investigated. In simulations
                  with conservation of mass the populations did not
                  evolve to sequence distributions with self-sustaining
                  reaction networks. Under the con- straint of constant
                  organization setting - reaction substrates remain in
                  the reactor, the total number of strings is kept
                  constant by an unspecific dilu- tion flux - reactivity
                  quickly increases and the population converges to some
                  self-sustaining sequence distribution. If reaction
                  substrates are replaced by mutants instead of being
                  left unchanged in the reactor, population development
                  strongly depends on replication accu- racy. At low
                  error rates we observe the formation of
                  quasi-stationary string length distributions, with
                  interactions between members of different string
                  length classes resulting in similar structures that
                  fulfill reaction criteria. These subpopulations of
                  same string length give rise to a self-sustaining net-
                  work of reactions. At higher mutation rates string
                  lengths are randomly distributed and reactivity stays
                  low. Self-sustaining populations which resulted from
                  simulations without muta- tion were perturbed by
                  introducing erroneous replication at error rates that
                  were previously found to allow for the development of
                  reaction networks. The original sets of sequences
                  quickly disappeared and were replaced by quasi-
                  stationary string length distributions that were again
                  self-sustaining. }

  abstract =     {The protein structure prediction problem is one of the most
  (if not the most) important problem in computational biology. This
  problem consists of finding the
  conformation of a protein (i.e., a sequence of amino-acids) with minimal
  energy. Because of the complexity of this
  problem, simplified lattice models like Dill's HP-model
  became a major tool for investigating general properties of protein
  folding. Even for this simplified model, the structure prediction problem
  has been shown to be NP-hard.

  So far, there is only one exact algorithm for
  attacking the structure prediction problem known in the literature, which is
  restricted to  one lattice model. This thesis presents an approach based on
  the constraint-based programming paradigm  to develop a framework that
  can be used for different lattice models.
  Thus, we introduce a constraint-based formulation for the HP-model, which
  applies a version of branch-and-bound to find the structure with minimal
  energy. In addition, we
  introduce redundant constraints to prune the search tree. We finally extend
  this framework to another lattice model, the HPNX-model.

  Major parts of this thesis are devoted to two subproblems: lower bounds on
  the energy and the exclusion of symmetries. Concerning the first part, we
  will give the first lower bounds on the energy given partial knowledge about
  the final
  conformation for both the cubic lattice (which is used in the HP-model),
  and the triangular (or face-centered-cubic) lattice.

  Concerning the second subproblem, the symmetries in lattice models are
  reflections and rotations that leave the lattice
  unchanged. For every conformation found or proven to be non-optimal, there
  are a lot of symmetric conformations with the same energy.
  Without symmetry exclusion, these symmetric conformations blow up the search
  tree considerably. We introduce the first method for excluding symmetries in
  constraint-based search that can be applied to arbitrary symmetries (as long
  as they can be defined declaratively).}

  year =         2003,
  abstract =     {When studying a set of related nucleotide or amino acid
                  sequences, we are interested in several questions:
                  What does the underlying tree look like? Which
                  positions in the sequences are homologous? What are
                  the characteristics of the evolutionary process that
                  led to these sequences? How reliable are our
                  deductions? We normally try to tackle these questions
                  by  rst constructing an optimal multiple alignment on
                  which we then base all our inference on the tree
                  topology and the parameters of the substitution model
                  we prefer. Due to highly elaborate alignment
                  (e. g. Thompson et al., 1994) and tree reconstruction
                  programs (e. g. Swo ord, 1991; Felsenstein, 1993;
                  Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996), this way of
                  proceeding is fast and certainly works well in most
                  cases. Nevertheless, it has several drawbacks:
                  Firstly, as we did not attempt to model the insertion
                  and deletion process explicitly, we can hardly make
                  any statements about the nature of this
                  process. Secondly, in order to  nd an optimal
                  alignment we have to specify mismatch and gap
                  penalties, thus making implicit assumptions about the
                  plausibility of substitutions, insertions and
                  deletions. Thirdly, multiple alignment methods either
                  align the sequences according to a prespeci ed
                  phylogenetic tree or ignore their evolutionary history
                  (cf. Gotoh, 1999). Either way, our estimate of the
                  phylogeny will be a ected. Finally, our knowledge of
                  the statistics of alignment scores and of the
                  behaviour of the heuristics which are used to come
                  close to the optimum is at the moment very
                  limited. Thus, the problem of phylogenetic analysis is
                  twofold: Our estimates of phylogenies and model
                  parameters are in uenced by the multiple alignments on
                  which we base our studies, yet we do not know how to
                  judge alignment errors and thus have no clue about the
                  reliability of our estimates. 

                  This thesis deals with some of these problems arising
                  at the junction between sequence alignment and
                  phylogeny reconstruction: After giving a brief
                  overview over some basic concepts and methods of
                  phylogenetic analysis in chapter 1, we will study the
                  in uence of global sequence alignment on the
                  estimation of pairwise distances (chapter 2) as well
                  as on the reconstruction of phylogentic trees (chapter
                  3). Chapter 4 gives an introduction into the
                  application of insertion and deletion models. These
                  models are then used to simultaneously reconstruct
                  phylogenies and multiple alignments (chapter
                  5). Finally, we describe in the appendices the usage
                  and some implementation details of the main programs
                  that were written for this thesis as well as some
                  possible generalizations of the models applied.},

                  spielen eine entscheidende Rolle bei der
                  posttranskriptionellen Genregulation von mRNAs. In
                  dieser Arbeit wurden bioinformatische Strategien zur
                  Vorhersage und Validierung potentiell regulatorischer
                  RNA-Motive entwickelt. Die Berechnung globaler und
                  lokaler Strukturalignments mit dem Programm
                  RNAforester führte zur Entwicklung einer sehr
                  flexiblen Strategie zur Vorhersage regulatorischer
                  RNA-Motive. Diese Strategie ermöglichte die Detektion
                  von RNA-Motiven unabhängig von ihrer Sequenz und
                  Position innerhalb verschiedener UTRs. Im Vergleich zu
                  anderen Vorhersagemethoden konnten Motive auch in sehr
                  großen Sekundärstrukturen gefunden werden. Für die
                  Validierung vorhergesagter Motive wurden
                  Datenbanksuchen durchgeführt. Dazu wurden ausgehend
                  von den Vorhersagen Muster definiert, die allgemein
                  genug sein mußten, um möglichst viele Vorkommen des
                  Musters zu  finden, die aber auch spezifisch genug sein
                  mußten, um möglichst wenige falsch positive Treffer zu
                  liefern. Um Muster mit solchen Eigenschaften de nieren
                  zu können, wurde ein Verfahren zur Musterevaluation
                  mit Hilfe von Signifikanzberechnungen eingesetzt. Für
                  die Datenbanksuche wurden die Programme RNAMotif und
                  HyPa verwendet, die speziell für die Suche nach
                  kombinierten RNA Sequenz- und Strukturmustern geeignet
                  sind. Darüber hinaus wurden die beiden Programme in
                  dieser Arbeit vergleichend analysiert. Die Anwendung
                  der entwickelten Strategien hat zur Vorhersage eines
                  potentiell regulatorischen Stemloops in der Rab1A
                  3'UTR von Mensch und Zitterrochen geführt. Die
                  Datenbanksuche hat ergeben, da  dieser Stemloop in den
                  Rab1A 3'UTRs verschiedener Vertebraten und der Sirtuin
                  2  3'UTR von Mensch und Maus vorkommt. Neben diesem
                  Motiv konnte auch eine verzweigte Stemloopstruktur in
                  einer alternativen Spleißvariante der BMP7 3'UTR des
                  Krallenfroschs entdeckt werden. Experimentelle
                  Analysen im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnten Hinweise auf
                  eine tatsächliche biologische Funktion des
                  vorhergesagten Stemloops in der Rab1A 3'UTR
                  liefern. Die Ergebnisse von Gelverzögerungs- und
                  Proteinisolierungsexperimenten legten die Interaktion
                  eines größeren Proteinkomplexes mit dem RNAStemloop
                  nahe. MALDI-TOF Analysen mehrerer Proteinbanden
                  ergaben, daß  ein potentielles RNA-Bindeprotein und der
                  'Rab GDP-dissociation-inhibitor' in dem Proteinkomplex
                  enthalten sein könnten. Die Durchführung von in vivo
                  Lokalisationsuntersuchungen mittels FRET-Technologie
                  zeigte eine Lokalisation der Rab1A mRNA an wenigen

  abstract =	 {Today, stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms 
                 belong to the standard methods for solving hard 
                 combinatorial problems from various areas of 
                 Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. 
                 Some of the most successful and powerful 
                 algorithms for prominent problems like SAT 
                 (the Satisfiability Problem in Propositional 
                 Logic), CSP (the Constraint Satisfaction Problem), 
                 TSP (the Traveling Salesperson Problem), or QAP 
                 (the Quadratic Assignment Problem), are based on 
                 stochastic local search.
                 
                 In this thesis we study various aspects of SLS 
                 algorithms, in particular we focus on modelling 
                 these algorithms, empirically evaluating their 
                 performance, characterising and improving their 
                 behaviour, and understanding the factors which 
                 influence their efficiency. We study these issues 
                 for the SAT problem in propositional logic as our 
                 primary application domain. SAT has the advantage 
                 of being conceptually very simple, which 
                 facilitates the design, implementation, and 
                 presentation of algorithms as well as their 
                 analysis. However, most of the methodology 
                 generalises easily to other combinatorial problems 
                 like CSP.
                 
                 We develop a new model especially suited for 
                 representing and developing hybrid SLS algorithms 
                 and a new empirical methodology for evaluating 
                 the behaviour of Las Vegas algorithms (a super-class 
                 of SLS algorithms). The results we present include 
                 a comparative study of various popular SLS 
                 algorithms' performance over a broad range of 
                 SAT instances, some theoretical result on the 
                 approximate completeness of modern SLS algorithms 
                 for SAT, an empirical characterisation of SLS 
                 behaviour, and finally, an analysis of how different 
                 SAT-encoding strategies affect search space structure 
                 and, consequently, SLS performance.}

  school = {Royal Institute of Technology},
  abstract={Aligning biological sequences, DNA or proteins, is to identify positions in sequences by inserting blanks in a way that maximizes an
objective function. The purpose is to understand how different sequences are evolutionary related and the objective function typically
measure the amount of sequence similarity. This thesis presents variations on the sequence alignment theme. 

   1.An algorithm for aligning coding but erroneous DNA is presented together with a discussion on algorithm variations. Simulations
    show that the algorithm offers good locality in determining the positions of sequence errors (lost or duplicated symbols). 
   2.An algorithm for efficiently aligning two protein sequences with respect to the underlying DNA coding is given. 
   3.When aligning several sequences simultaneously, memory is a more limited resource than time. Two algorithms are given that
    reduce the memory requirements for computing optimal alignments. 
   4.Recently, a new optimization objective for sequence alignments was suggested. It maximizes the cumulative correctness of
    individual alignment columns instead of maximizing the whole alignment. Two algorithms that reduce the memory usage are
    developed. The first has been implemented and is shown to be practical and useful. 
   5.It is shown how to compute the average alignment column correctness. This is a novel alignment objective and its performance
    compared with cumulative alignment correctness using a practical algorithm. 
   6.The question of determining if an alignment score is significant or not is addressed. A method for creating threshold is introduced
    and compared to other techniques in an extensive benchmark. Different scoring schemes are also evaluated},

Diese Dissertation beschaftigt sich mit statistischen Fragen optimaler Sequenzalignments. Optimale Sequenzalignments sind ein wichtiges Werkzeug bei der automatisierten Suche nach  Ahnlichkeiten zwischen DNA- oder Aminos auresequenzen. Im Labor neu bestimmte Sequenzen werden heutzutage routinema ig mit gro en Datenbanken bekannter Sequenzen verglichen. Die dabei verwendeten Programme bestimmen ein optimales lokales Alignment zwischen der neuen Sequenz und der gesamten Datenbank zusammen mit dem Score des Alignments. Der ermittelte Score ist ein Ma  fur die Gute des Alignments | je hoher der Score, desto besser das Alignment. Bei einer solchen Datenbanksuche stellt sich direkt die Frage nach der Normierung dieser durch den Alignmentscore de nierten Ahnlichkeitsskala. Selbst wenn alle beteiligten Sequenzen rein zufallig erzeugt waren, und demnach keine systematischen Ahnlichkeiten aufwiesen, wurden hohe Scorewerte oftmals auch per Zufall erzielt werden. Wie hoch muss also ein Score sein, damit man annehmen kann, dass er nicht auch schon durch Zufall hatte erzielt werden konnen? Oder, praziser ausgedruckt: Wie wahrscheinlich ist es unter dem Nullmdell unabhangiger, zufalliger Sequenzen, optimale lokale Scores zu erhalten, die eine vorgegebene hohe Schranke ubersteigen? Diese Wahrscheinlichkeit wird auch als der p-Wert der Schranke bezeichnet. Dieser Frage geht diese Dissertation nach. Dabei untersuchen wir speziell den Fall optimaler lokaler Alignments, in denen auch Lucken erlaubt sind.

  abstract =     {RNA pseudoknots represent a particularly interesting structural motif in func- tional RNA molecules. They can be involved in translational and replicational control, or are necessary to form reaction centers of certain ribozymes. The conventional de nition of RNA secondary structures excludes pseudoknots ex- plicitly, mainly for computational reasons. In this thesis the RNA secondary structure de nition was extended to include the so called h-type pseudoknots. H-type pseudoknots are the most abundant of all known pseudoknots, further- more they are the only type of pseudoknot for which an energy model exists. Consequently, the structural diversity of h-pseudoknots is restricted to the domain of the energy model. Most of these restrictions are stereo-chemically motivated and comprise almost all experimentally known h-pseudoknots. As a result, dynamic programming becomes feasible in terms of time and memory demand. A minimum free energy folding algorithm was implemented which requires O(mn 3 ) time and O(mn 2 ) memory, where n is the length of the molecule and m is a constant depending on the structural freedom approved to the pseudoknot. Additionally the backtracking process was adapted as well, to calculate all suboptimal structures within a given energy range above the minimum free energy. However, kinetically determined phenomena are not directly accessible with this approach but need su cient knowledge about the RNA energy landscape. Therefore an existing high resolution kinetic folding algorithm was adopted which uses an elementary move set for the inter con- version of RNA secondary structures, consisting of the closing and opening of a single base pair. The pseudoknot-speci c part of this algorithm pro- duces a list of neighbors for any given structure, according to this move set. Together with the suboptimal folding algorithm, the neighbor generating func- tion is a prerequisite for another algorithm that provides detailed information about the energy landscape, such as local minima and folding pathways. The combination of all these methods provides a comprehensive tool to study the implications of pseudoknot formation on the energy landscape. RNA conformational switches are an ideal opportunity to apply the complete set of algorithms developed. They consist of two competing secondary structures that show mutually exclusive base pair patterns but nearly equal free energy. With the help of pseudoknots, the primarily high energy bar- rier between the two conformations can be lowered signi cantly by providing alternative folding paths.}

  school =	 {University of California, Santa Cruz},
  year =	 1999,
  abstract =	 {Recent developments in high-throughput biological
                  technologies have created a wealth of biological
                  sequence data. The immense size of these biological
                  datasets has prompted the use of computational
                  methods for their analysis. This work presents the
                  theory and application of stochastic context-free
                  grammars (SCFGs) to biological sequence analysis and
                  specifically to the problem of RNA secondary
                  structure modeling. SCFGs are a method of
                  characterizing biological sequences that take into
                  account the statistical identity of different
                  sequence positions including pairwise interactions
                  between positions. It is their ability to model
                  pairwise interacting positions that make SCFGs a
                  natural mathematical model of RNA secondary
                  structure. SCFGs can automatically generate
                  structural multiple alignments of RNA families that
                  take into account basepairing interactions. SCFGs
                  are presented as an extension of another
                  probabilistic model used in biological sequence
                  analysis, hidden Markov models. I present several
                  SCFG algorithm developments including a SCFG
                  constraint system that gives significant performance
                  enhancements in both time and space and allows large
                  SCFGs to be applied to large sequence analysis
                  problems. I give a method using intersected SCFGs to
                  model non-context-free structures. I also introduce
                  a new method of sequence classification using a
                  support vector machine framework and feature vectors
                  generated from a SCFG. I apply the SCFG method to an
                  {\em in vitro} selected RNA pseudoknot that binds
                  biotin. Even though SCFGs cannot model the RNA
                  pseudoknot structure directly, I show that an
                  approximation using two SCFGs can effectively
                  perform database searches and find RNA pseudoknot
                  structures. I then apply SCFGs to modeling small
                  subunit ribosomal RNA, a large molecule that is
                  important to the construction of phylogenetic trees
                  of life. I compare the SCFG method to several other
                  methods in constructing multiple alignments of this
                  molecule and show that the SCFG outperforms the
                  other methods, attaining a multiple alignment whose
                  quality is close to hand-edited alignments. I apply
                  SCFGs with support vector machines to a phylogenetic
                  classification problem and show that they outperform
                  a standard method. I describe the SCFG RNA modeling
                  software, RNACAD, that was used in this work.},

  title =        {Exact and Approximation Algorithms for DNA Sequence Reconstruction},
  school =       {University of Arizona},
  year =         1991,
  abstract  =    {The DNA sequence in every human being is a text of
                  three billion characters from a four letter alphabet;
                  determining this sequence is a major project in
                  molecular biology. The fundamental task biologists
                  face is to reconstruct a long sequence given short
                  fragments from unknown locations. These fragments
                  contain errors, and may represent the sequence on one
                  strand of the double-helix, or the reverse complement
                  sequence on the other strand. The Sequence
                  Reconstruction Problem is, given a collection F of
                  fragment sequences and an error rate 0 <= e < 1, find
                  a shortest sequence S such that every fragment F, or
                  its reverse complement, matches a substring of S with
                  at most e|F| errors.  Sequence Reconstruction is
                  NP-complete. We decompose the problem into (1)
                  constructing a graph of approximate overlaps between
                  pairs of fragments, (2) selecting a set of overlaps of
                  maximum total weight that induce a consistent layout
                  of the fragments, (3) merging the overlaps into a
                  multiple sequence alignment and voting on a
                  consensus. A solution to (1) through (3) yields a
                  reconstructed sequence feasible at error rate 2e/(1-e)
                  and at most a factor 1/(1-e) longer than the shortest
                  reconstruction, given some assumptions on fragment
                  error. We define a measure of the overlap in a
                  reconstruction, show that maximizing the overlap
                  minimizes the length, and that approximating (2)
                  within a factor of a approximates Sequence
                  Reconstruction within a factor of (1-e)a under the
                  overlap measure. We construct the overlap graph for
                  (1) in O(eN2) time given fragments of total length N
                  at error rate e. We develop two exact and two
                  approximation algorithms for (2). Our best exact
                  algorithm computes an optimal layout for a graph of E
                  overlaps and V fragments in O(K(E + V log V)) time,
                  where K <= 2 up to E is the size of the
                  branch-and-bound search tree. Our best approximation
                  algorithm computes a layout with overlap at least
                  1\x{2044}2 the maximum in O(V (E + V log V) log V)
                  time. We construct the multiple sequence alignment and
                  consensus sequence for (3) in O(H2L+M+N) time given a
                  layout with at most H mutually overlapping fragments,
                  where L is the length of the alignment and M is the
                  number of pairs of aligned characters in the
                  overlaps. We evaluate an implementation by comparing
                  the computed reconstruction to the sampled
                  sequence. For a random sequence of length 50,000
                  sampled at 10\% error with 500 fragments of length
                  500, the software reconstructed the correct
                  layout. For a human DNA sequence of length 50,000
                  containing 18 repeated elements of length 300 to 2,000
                  sampled as above at 5\% error, the software found a
                  shorter layout, though over 95\% of the layout was
                  correct. When covered by three or more fragments, the
                  reconstructed sequence had less than 1 error in 5,000
                  characters, given input with 1 error in 10. This is
                  the first treatment of Sequence Reconstruction with
                  inexact data and unknown complementarity.},

                  services at a high level. Spacesare seamlessly
                  integrated into a concurrent programming langu age
                  and make constraintbased computations compatible
                  with concurrency through en capsulation.Spaces are
                  applied to search and combinators as essential
                  constraint services. Stateof-the-art and new search
                  engines such as visual interactive sea rch and
                  parallel search are covered. Search is expressive
                  and concurrency-compat ible by using copying
                  ratherthan trailing. Search is space and time
                  efficient by using recomputation. Composable
                  combinators, also known as deep-guard combinators,
                  stress the control facilities andconcurrency
                  integration of spaces. The implementation of spaces
                  comes as an orthogonal extension to the implementat
                  ion of the underlying programming language. The
                  resulting implementation is show nto be competitive

  title = {{F}rom {A}rtifcial {E}volution to {A}rtifcial {L}ife},
  school = {Univ. of Edinburgh},
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {{T}his work addresses the question: {W}hat are the basic design considerations
	for creating a synthetic model of the evolution of living systems
	(i.e. an 'artifcial life' system)? {I}t can also be viewed as an
	attempt to elucidate the logical structure (in a very general sense)
	of biological evolution. {H}owever, with no adequate defnition of
	life, the experimental portion of the work concentrates on more specifc
	issues, and primarily on the issue of open-ended evolution. {A}n
	artifcial evolutionary system called {C}osmos, which provides a virtual
	operating system capable of simulating the parallel processing and
	evolution of a population of several thousand self-reproducing computer
	programs, is introduced. {C}osmos is related to {R}ay's established
	{T}ierra system [{R}ay 91], but there are a number of signifcant
	diferences. {A} wide variety of experiments with {C}osmos, which
	were designed to investigate its evolutionary dynamics, are reported.
	{A}n analysis of the results is presented, with particular attention
	given to the role of contingency in determining the outcome of the
	runs. {T}he results of this work, and consideration of the existing
	literature on artifcial evolutionary systems, leads to the conclusion
	that artifcial life models such as this are lacking on a number of
	theoretical and methodological grounds. {I}t is emphasised that explicit
	theoretical considerations shouldguide the design of such models,
	if they are to be of scientifc value. {A}n analysis ofvarious issues
	relating to self-reproduction, especially in the context of evolution,
	is presented, including some extensions to von {N}eumann's analysis
	of self-reproduction [von {N}eumann 66]. {T}his suggests ways in
	which the evolutionary potential of such models might be improved.
	{I}n particular, a shift of focus is recommended towards a more careful
	consideration of the phenotypic capabilities of the reproducing individuals.
	{P}henotypic capabilities fundamentally involve interactions with
	the environment (both abiotic and biotic), and it is further argued
	that the theoretical grounding upon which these models should be
	based must include consideration of the kind of environments and
	the kind of interactions required for open-ended evolution. {A} number
	of useful future research directions are identifed. {F}inally, the
	relevance of such work to the original goal of modelling the evolution
	of living systems (as opposed to the more general goal of modelling
	open-ended evolution) is discussed. {I}t is suggested that the study
	of open-ended evolution can lead us to a better understanding of
	the essential properties of life, but only if the questions being
	asked in these studies are phrased appropriately.},

  abstract =	 {An amorphous computing medium is a system of
                  irregularly placed, asynchronous, locally
                  interacting computing elements. I have demonstrated
                  that amorphous media can be configured by a program,
                  common to all computing elements, to generate highly
                  complex prespecified patterns. For example, I can
                  specify that an amorphous medium manifest a pattern
                  representing the interconnection structure of an
                  arbitrary electrical circuit. My strategy is
                  inspired by a botanical metaphor based on growing
                  points and tropisms. To make this strategy explicit,
                  I have developed the Growing Point Language (GPL). A
                  growing point is a locus of activity in an amorphous
                  medium. A growing point propagates through the
                  medium by transferring its activity from one
                  computing element to a neighbor. As a growing point
                  passes through the medium it effects the
                  differentiation of the behaviors of the computing
                  elements it visits. The trajectory of the growing
                  point is controlled by signals that are
                  automatically carried through the medium from other
                  differentiated elements. Such a response is called a
                  tropism. In this way a GPL program can exploit
                  locality to make crude geometric inferences. There
                  is a wide variety of patterns that are expressible
                  in GPL. Examples include: Euclidean constructions,
                  branching structures and simple text. I prove that
                  amorphous media can be programmed to draw any
                  prespecified planar graph, and I obtain upper bounds
                  on the amount of storage required by the individual
                  processors to realize such a graph. I also analyze
                  how the effectiveness of GPL programs depends upon
                  the distribution of the computing elements. }

the mathematics of these structures. The basic objects of study are
the leaf labelled tree and its substructures: quartets, splits,
clusters and rooted triples, among others. We present fundamental
theorems and characterisations, as well as efficient algorithms for a
range of phylogenetic problems.

It is often possible to deduce phylogenetic information not in the
original data. We characterise an intriguing system of inference
`rules' that arise in this way, and prove that there exist rules of
every order that cannot be reduced to lower order rules.

We describe a polynomial time algorithm that extracts maximum weight
bounded degree trees from a given binary character set. The algorithm
enables compatibility analysis of large data sets, in this case the
daunting "Out of Africa" human mtDNA sequences. Other applications
include consensus, quartet puzzling and split decomposition.

We accelerate the Minimum Evolution method with an optimal O(n2) time
algorithm for calculating OLS edge lengths and fast algorithms for
WLS and GLS edge lengths. We show how a Minimum Evolution tree can be
efficiently extracted from a collection of splits.

Consensus methods are surveyed, characterised and classified. A new
intuitive consensus method for edge weighted trees is introduced,

  abstract =     {Secondary structures of nucleic acids are a particularly interes
ting class of contact structures. Many important RNA molecules,however contain pseud
oknots, which are excluded explicitly by the definition of secondary structures. We
propose here a generalization of secondary structures that incorporates "non-nested"
 pseudoknots. We also introduce a measure for the complexity of more general contact
 structures in terms of the chromatic number of their intersection graph. We show th
at RNA structures without nested pseudoknots form a special class of planar graphs,
the so called "bi-secondary structures". Upper bounds on their number are derived, s
howing that there are fewer different structures than sequences. An energy function
capable of dealing with bi-secondary structures was implemented into a generalized k
inetic folding algorithm. Sterical hindrances involved in pseudoknot formation are t
aken into account with the help of two simplifications: stacked regions are viewed a
s stiff rods and unpaired bases are assumed to be very flexible. Three parameters ar
e employed in the energy function to consider the sterical situation. The parameter
adjustment demands a rather heuristic approach. A variety of experimentally determin
ed bi-secondary structures were used as target structures in a series of folding pro
cedures with different parameters. For short range pseudoknots a suitable parameter
set was found. Different parameter sets were used to study the mapping from sequence
s to bi-secondary structures. Statistics of bi-secondary structure elements as well
as the frequency distribution of bi-secondary structures were computed. The frequenc
y distribution can be described by a generalized form of Zipf's law, which means tha
t there are view common structures and many rare ones. Neutral nets (neighboring seq
uences sharing the same structure) of bi-secondary structures were compared with tho
se calculated for pure secondary structures and found to be less extended.}

                  utilising and maintaining RDF in real world
                  applications, and turns to graph theory in search of
                  solutions to these problems. The importance of graph
                  matching techniques is demonstrated as a source of
                  answers for enabling greater  exibility in working
                  with RDF. The thesis shows how detection of the
                  maximum common subgraph of two graphs can be useful in
                  the context of solving consistency and validity
                  problems in RDF, and compares and contrasts two
                  previously developed algorithms for performing this
                  task. A third, new algorithm is then implemented,
                  using properties from the previous two to form an
                  inexact, but e cient method for  nding the maximum
                  common subgraph of a pair of graphs. This algorithm
                  provides a useful tool for operating with RDF
                  ontologies.}

                  structures have grown increasingly important with
                  the recent and rapid growth of the protein structure
                  database. Several techniques are currently available
                  that attempt to find the optimal alignment of shared
                  structural motifs between two proteins. Our goal in
                  this paper is to quantitatively compare the
                  sensitivity and specificity of some of these

    to modeling protein flexibility. In International Conference on Computational
    Molecular Biology (RECOMB), April 2002.",

  abstract = {Proteins are involved either directly or indirectly in all
                  biological processes in living organisms. It is now
                  widely accepted that conformational changes of
                  proteins can critically affect their ability to bind
                  other molecules and that any progress in modeling
                  protein motion and flexibility will contribute to the
                  understanding of key biological fimctions. However,
                  modeling protein flexibility has proven a very
                  difficult task. Experimental laboratory methods such
                  as X-ray crystallography produce rather few
                  structures, while computational methods such as
                  Molecular Dynamics are too slow for routine use with
                  large systems. A medium sized protein typically has a
                  few thousands of degrees of freedom. This paper shows
                  how to obtain a reduced basis representation of
                  protein flexibility. We use the Principal Component
                  Analysis method, a dimensionality reduction technique,
                  to transform the original high dimensional
                  representation of protein motion into a lower
                  dimensional representation that captures the dominant
                  modes of motions of the protein. Although there is
                  inevitably some loss in accuracy, we show that we can
                  obtain conformations that have been observed in
                  laboratory experiments, starting from different
                  initial conformations and working in a drastically
                  reduced search space.}}

                  approach is here considered. This approach can be
                  naturally divided into two sub-problems: the problem
                  of choosing which cluster must be divided, and the
                  problem of splitting the selected cluster. The focus
                  here is on the first problem. The contribution of
                  this work is to propose a new simple technique for
                  the selection of the cluster to split. This
                  technique is based upon the shape of the
                  cluster. This result is presented with reference to
                  two specific splitting algorithms: the celebrated
                  bisecting K-means algorithm, and the recently
                  proposed Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning
                  (PDDP) algorithm. The problem of evaluating the

                  Markov model to extract factual information from a
                  corpus of machine-readable English prose. In
                  particular, the thesis presents a HMM that
                  classifies and parses natural language assertions
                  about genes being located at particular positions on
                  chromosomes. The facts extracted by this HMM can be
                  inserted into biological databases. The HMM is
                  trained on a small set of sentence fragments chosen
                  from the collected scientific abstracts in the OMIM
                  (On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database and
                  judged to contain the target binary relationship
                  between gene names and gene locations. Given a novel
                  sentence, all contiguous fragments are ranked by
                  log-odds score, i.e. the log of the ratio of the
                  probability of the fragment according to the target
                  HMM to that according to a null HMM trained on all
                  OMIM sentences. The most probable path through the
                  HMM gives bindings for the annotations with
                  precision as high as 80%. In contrast with
                  traditional natural language processing methods,
                  this stochastic approach makes no use either of
                  part-of-speech taggers or dictionaries, instead
                  employing non-emitting states to assemble modules
                  roughly corresponding to noun, verb, and
                  prepostional phrases. Algorithms for reestimating
                  parameters for HMMs with non-emitting states are
                  presented in detail. The ability to tolerate new
                  words and recognize a wide variety of syntactic
                  forms arises from the judicious use of gap states."

      A hyperbibliography on the subject of Molecular Computation and
      the related theoretical model of Splicing Systems.

      Molecular Computation is computation using (biological)
      macromolecules like DNA as information carriers, that are
      manipulated using biological operators, such as enzymes,
      and operations commonly used in bio-technology and genetic
      manipulation, such as filtering operations and the polymerase
      chain reaction. It has received much attention following Adleman's
      seminal article Adleman (1994).

      Splicing Systems are models in Formal Language Theory that use the
      splicing operator instead of concatenation. The splicing operator
      is an operator on two strings that is an abstraction of the effect
      of restriction enzymes on strands of double-stranded DNA combined
      with ligation. It was introduced in Head87.

Computed structures and free energies depend strongly on both

parameter sets. Statistical properties, such as mean numbers of base
pairs, mean
numbers of stacks, mean loop sizes, etc., are much less sensitive to
the choices of
parameter sets and even algorithms. Some features of RNA secondary
structures,
like structure correlation functions, shape space covering and
neutral networks,
seem to depend only on the base pairing logic (GC or AUGC alphabet).

  the quality of your research publications in high-quality journals
  and conference proceedings. Of the three classical rhetorical
  techniques, it is logos, rather than pathos or ethos, which is most
  commonly associated with scientific publications. In the
  mathematical sciences the paradigm for publication is to describe
  the mathematical proofs of propositions in sufficient detail to
  allow duplication by interested readers. Quality control is achieved
  by a system of peer review commonly referred to as refereeing.

  This guide is an attempt to distill the experience of the
  theoretical computer science community on the subject of refereeing
  into a convenient form which can be easily distributed to students
  and other inexperienced referees. Although aimed primarily at
  theoretical computer scientists, it contains advice which may be
  relevant to other mathematical sciences. It may also be of some use
  to new authors who are unfamiliar with the peer review
  process. However, it must be understood that this is not a guide on
  how to write papers. Authors who are interested in improving their
  writing skills can consult the "Further Reading" section.}

                  si- multaneously. This allows a global view on the
                  tran- scription levels of many (or all) genes when
                  the cell undergoes specific conditions or
                  processes. Analyzing gene expression data requires
                  the clustering of genes into groups with similar
                  expression patterns. We have developed a novel
                  clustering algorithm, called CLICK, which is
                  applicable to gene expression analysis as well as to
                  other biological applications. No prior assump-
                  tions are made on the structure or the number of the
                  clusters. The algorithm utilizes graph-theoretic and
                  statistical techniques to identify tight groups of
                  highly similar elements (kernels), which are likely
                  to belong to the same true cluster. Several
                  heuristic procedures are then used to expand the
                  kernels into the full clustering. <p> CLICK has been
                  implemented and tested on a variety of biological
                  datasets, ranging from gene expression, cDNA
                  oligo-fingerprinting to protein sequence similar-
                  ity. In all those applications it outperformed
                  extant al- gorithms according to several common
                  figures of merit. CLICK is also very fast, allowing
                  clustering of thou- sands of elements in minutes,
                  and over 100,000 ele- ments in a couple of hours on

This editor, however, does not handle \LaTeX\ environments (such as

  title =	 "CLUSEQ: Efficient and Effective Sequence Clustering",
  abstract =	 "Analyzing sequence data has become increasingly
                  important recently in the area of biological
                  sequences, text documents, web access logs, etc. In
                  this paper, we investigate the problem of clustering
                  sequences based on their structural features. As a
                  widely recognized technique, clustering has proven
                  to be very useful in detecting unknown object
                  categories and revealing hidden correlations among
                  objects. One difficulty that prevents clustering
                  from being performed extensively on sequence data
                  (in categorical domain) is the lack of an effective
                  yet efficient similarity measure. Therefore, we
                  propose a novel model (CLUSEQ) for sequence cluster
                  by exploring significant statistical properties
                  possessed by the sequences. The conditional
                  probability distribution (CPD) of the next symbol
                  given a preceding segment is derived and used to
                  characterize sequence behavior and to support the
                  similarity measure. A variation of the suffix tree,
                  namely probabilistic suffix tree, is employed to
                  organize (the significant portion of) the CPD in a
                  concise way. A novel algorithm is devised to
                  efficiently discover clusters with high quality and
                  is able to automatically adjust the number of
                  clusters to its optimal range via a unique
                  combination of successive new cluster generation and
                  cluster consolidation. The performance of CLUSEQ has
                  been demonstrated via extensive experiments on
                  several real and synthetic sequence databases.",

  abstract = {This course is targeted to everyone interested in
  solving real-life combinatorial problems using the techniques of
  constraint satisfaction. After attending the course, the attendees
  should have a broad view of constraint satisfaction techniques and
  detail knowledge of the fundamental solving algorithms.

  The course provides a deep and broad survey of algorithms for
  constraint satisfaction. A notion of constraint satisfaction problem
  (CSP) is defined and the methods for conversion to binary
  constraints are presented. Then we describe the local search
  techniques for solving CSP's, including the algorithms like hill
  climbing, min-conflicts, and tabu search. Systematic search
  algorithms are presented next, starting from chronological
  backtracking, continuing through conflict-directed backjumping and
  backmarking and concluding with the discrepancy based search. A
  significant part of the course is dedicated to the description of
  the consistency techniques (constraint propagation) for reducing the
  search space. We present the algorithms for node, arc and path
  consistency and explain the general notions of k-consistency,
  (i,j)-consistency, inverse consistency, and singleton
  consistency. We also show how the consistency techniques are
  combined with enumeration (search) in forward checking and look
  ahead methods. The course is concluded with the notes about solving
  optimisation and over-constrained problems.},

    of the Sequence to Structure Mapping in {RNA}",
  year = {1994},
  abstract = {RNA folding is viewed here as a map assigning secondary structures to
sequences and hence as an example of general genotype to phenotype mappings.
RNA secondary structures can be represented as planar vertex-labeled
graphs or as trees. We construct recursion formulae enumerating various
sub-classes of these graphs as well as certain structural elements and derive
first order asymptotics for their frequencies. The number of secondary structures
at fixed chain length turns out to be much lower than the number of
sequences.
A package of e#cient algorithms for the prediction of RNA secondary
structures and their comparison is introduced. It is complemented by a novel
heuristic "inverse folding" algorithm that searches for
sequences which fold into a given secondary structure.
The mapping from sequences to secondary structures is then studied in
a series of computer experiments. Statistics of secondary structure
elements of folded random sequences are compiled and compared to random
structures.
In addition, we derive a lower bound on the number of folded
structures from the mean number of base pairs. The frequency distribution of
structures is found to be highly nonuniform, with few common structures and many
rare ones, to a good approximation the distribution can be described
by a generalized form of Zipf's law. Using the inverse folding algorithm
sequences folding into some given structure are shown to be randomly
distributed in sequence space.
As a consequence of the many to one mapping, common structures can be
found within a relatively small distance (less than 20% of the
diameter of sequence space) from any random sequence. Furthermore, the high
number of neutral mutations leads to extended networks of neighboring
sequences sharing the same structure. Neutral nets belo...},

	promoter activity in {S}etty et. al. {PNAS} 2003. {I}n order to find
	a suitable formula for the promoter activity of the lac{ZYA} operon
	we constructed a mathematical model which incorporate the various
	chemical reactions between the inducers, the transcription factors({TF})
	and the promoter sites in the lac{ZYA} system. {E}ach {TF} is activated
	(or deactivated) by the binding of a specific inducer. {E}ach site
	may be free or occupied by one or more proteins. {I}n turn, the specific
	proteins which binds to the {DNA} site determines the promoter activity
	i.e. amount of m{RNA} produced per unit time. {T}he present model
	is not meant to be a detailed account of the full biochemistry of
	the {L}ac system, rather a toy model that captures the essential
	behavior. {F}or example, multi-operator {DNA} loops in the system
	may introduce additional effects. {F}urthermore interaction between
	{CRP} and {L}ac{I} can be added to the model, however it was found
	that this does not improve the fit to the experimental data, and

The intended audience was mathematically inclined engineering graduate students and visiting scholars who had not had formal courses in measure theoretic probability.

  abstract = "The problem of efficiently locating previously known patterns in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has received much attention and may now largely be regarded as a solved problem. However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns  motifs,  because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition, it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification. In this work we carefully motivate, then introduce, a non-trivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to discover them, and we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach on several real world datasets."

@Misc{ note1, note = {{Let $i$, $j$, $k$, $l$ denote positions of
  bases in the linear sequence and $(i,j)$ a base pair. The secondary
  structure of an RNA sequence is defined as the set $P$ of allowed
  base pairs (here Watson-Crick pairs plus GU) which minimize free
  energy, subject to a no-knot condition requiring that if $(i,j)$ and
  $(k,l)$ are both in $P$, then $i<k<j$ implies $i<l<j$ (i.e.~base
  pairs don't cross).  The secondary structure is computed with our
  implementation \cite{Hofacker:94} of a dynamic programming
  algorithm, originally due to
  \cite{Nussinov:78,Waterman:78a,Zuker:81}, which is widely used in

	networks. Interest has focused mainly on the structural properties
	of random complex networks in communications, biology, social sciences
	and economics. A number of giant artificial networks of such a kind
	came into existence recently. This opens a wide field for the study
	of their topology, evolution, and complex processes occurring in
	them. Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number
	of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random
	breakdowns. In spite of large sizes of these networks, the distances
	between most their vertices are short -- a feature known as the ``small-world''
	effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free
	structures and the role of the mechanism of preferential linking.
	We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving
	networks, and percolation in these networks. We present a number
	of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and
	discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study.
	Applications of the general results to particular networks in Nature
	are discussed. We demonstrate the generic connections of the network
	growth processes with the general problems of non-equilibrium physics,
	econophysics, evolutionary biology, etc.},

  abstract =	 "Clustering is a division of data into groups of
                  similar objects. Representing the data by fewer
                  clusters necessarily loses certain fine details, but
                  achieves simplification. It models data by its
                  clusters. Data modeling puts clustering in a
                  historical perspective rooted in mathematics,
                  statistics, and numerical analysis. From a machine
                  learning perspective clusters correspond to hidden
                  patterns, the search for clusters is unsupervised
                  learning, and the resulting system represents a data
                  concept. From a practical perspective clustering
                  plays an outstanding role in data mining
                  applications such as scientific data exploration,
                  information retrieval and text mining, spatial
                  database applications, Web analysis, CRM, marketing,
                  medical diagnostics, computational biology, and many
                  others. Clustering is the subject of active research
                  in several fields such as statistics, pattern
                  recognition, and machine learning. This survey
                  focuses on clustering in data mining. Data mining
                  adds to clustering the complications of very large
                  datasets with very many attributes of different
                  types. This imposes unique computational
                  requirements on relevant clustering algorithms. A
                  variety of algorithms have recently emerged that
                  meet these requirements and were successfully
                  applied to real-life data mining problems. They are
                  subject of the survey.",

                  task. Search can be speeded up by exploring subtrees
                  of a search tree in parallel. This paper presents
                  distributed search engines that achieve parallelism
                  by distribution across networked computers. The main
                  point of the paper is a simple design of the
                  parallel search engine. Simplicity comes as an
                  immediate consequence of clearly separating search,
                  concurrency, and distribution. The obtained
                  distributed search engines are simple yet offer
                  substantial speedup on standard network computers.}

  abstract = {Dynamic programming is a classic programming technique, applicable in a wide variety of domains, like stochastic systems analysis, operations research, combinatorics of discrete structures, ow problems, parsing ambiguous languages, or biosequence analysis. Yet, heretofore no methodology was available guiding the design of such algorithms. The matrix recurrences that typically describe a dynamic programming algorithm are di cult to construct, error-prone to implement, and almost impossible to debug. This article introduces an algebraic style of dynamic programming over sequence data. We de ne its formal framework including a formalization of Bellman's principle. We suggest a language for algorithm design on a convenient level of abstraction. We outline three ways of implementation, including an embedding in a lazy functional language. The workings of the new method are illustrated by a series of examples from diverse areas of computer science.}

We present a new method to evaluate all possible internal loops of size at most k in an RNA sequence, s, intimeO(k j s j 2 ); this is an improve- ment from the previously used method that uses time O(k 2 j s j 2 ). For unlimited loop size this improves the overall complexity of evaluating RNA secondary structures from O( j s j 4 ) to O( j s j 3 ) and the method applies equally well to  nding the optimal structure and calculating the equilibrium partition function. We use our method to examine the soundness of setting k = 30, a commonly used heuristic.},

For example, we do not know how to characterize the class of processes that can be well approximated by HMMs. This thesis tries to uncover the source of the intrinsic expressiveness of HMMs by studying when and why two models may represent the same stochasti
c process. Define two statistical models to be equivalent if they are models of exactly the same process. We use the theorems proved in this thesis to develop polynomial time algorithms to detect equivalence of prior distributions on an HMM, equivalence of HMMs and equivalence of HMMs with fixed priors. We characterize Hidden Markov Models in terms of equivalence classes whose elements represent exactly the same processes and proceed to describe an algorithm to reduce HMMs to essentially unique and minimal, canonical representations. These canonical forms are essentially smallest representatives of their equivalence classes, and the number of parameters describing them can be considered a representation for the complexity of the stochastic process they model. On the way to developing our reduction algorithm, we define Generalized Markov Models which relax the positivity constraint on HMM parameters. This generalization is derived by taking the view that an interpretation of model parameters as probabilities is less important than a parsimonious representation of stochastic processes."

algorithm, Tree-Grammar EM, based on tre e grammars and faster than
the previously proposed SCFG inside-outside training algorithm,
produced a model that we tested on the transfer RNA (tRNA) family. Re
sults show that after having been trained on as few as 20 tRNA
sequences from on ly two tRNA subfamilies (mitochondrial and
cytoplasmic), the model can discern g eneral tRNA from similarlength
RNA sequences of other kinds, can find secondary structure of new tRNA
sequences, and can produce multiple alignments of large se ts of tRNA
sequences. Our results suggest potential improvements in the alignmen

                  procedures have been developed for this purpose;
                  most are based on clustering the sequences
                  hierarchically prior to the computation of their
                  alignment and then proceeding recursively. <p> In
                  this paper, we compare results obtained with a new
                  algorithm for simultaneous multiple sequence
                  alignment, the so-called Divide & Conquer Alignment
                  procedure (DCA), with results obtained with
                  iterative procedures. DCA allows one to
                  simultaneously align relatively large families of
                  sequences using computationally efficient heuristics
                  which - relative to the sum-of-pairs scoring
                  function which DCA accepts as the standard of truth
                  - give rise to good (though not necessarily optimal)
                  alignments. <p> As expected, the simultaneous
                  alignments often prove superior in picking up
                  biologically important signals contained in a family
                  of highly diverged sequences, which are sometimes
                  overlooked by successive pairwise alignment.}

  abstract = {Tettelin et. al. proposed a new method for closing the

  multiplex PCR strategy in order to minimize the time and effort
  required to sequence the DNA in the missing gaps. This procedure has
  been used in a number of microbial sequencing projects including
  Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria. In this paper we
  describe a theoretical framework for this problem and propose an
  improved method that minimizes the number of steps involved in the
  gap closure procedures, with high probability. In particular, given
  a collection of n/2 DNA fragments we describe a strategy that
  requires 0.75nlogn work in eight parallel rounds of experiments,
  closely matching a corresponding lower bound of 0.5nlogn even for
  sequential algorithms.},

  abstract =	 {Multiple sequence alignment is an important problem
                  in computational biology. We study the Maximum Trace
                  formulation introduced by Kececioglu [Kec91]. We
                  first phrase the problem in terms of forbidden
                  subgraphs, which enables us to express Maximum Trace
                  as an integer linear-programming problem, and then
                  solve the integer linear program using methods from
                  polyhedral combinatorics. The trace polytope is the
                  convex hull of all feasible solutions to the Maximum
                  Trace problem; for the case of two sequences, we
                  give a complete characterization of this
                  polytope. This yields a polynomialtime algorithm for
                  a general version of pairwise sequence alignment
                  that, perhaps suprisingly, does not use dynamic
                  programming; this yields, for instance, a
                  nondynamic-programming algorithm for sequence
                  comparison under the 0-1 metric, which gives another
                  answer to a long-open question in the area of string
                  algorithms [PW93]. For the multiple-sequence case,
                  we derive several classes of facet-defining
                  inequalities and show that for all but one class,
                  the corresponding separation problem can be solved
                  in polynomial time. This leads to a branch-and-cut
                  algorithm for multiple sequence alignment, and we
                  report on our first computational experience. It
                  appears that a polyhedral approach to multiple
                  sequence alignment can solve instances that are
                  beyond present dynamic-programming approaches.},

  abstract =	 {A combinatorial design problem is considered which can be
modelled as a constraint satisfaction problem in several different
ways. The models all have a large number of symmetries which cause
diAEculties when searching for solutions. Different approaches to
reducing the symmetry are discussed: remodelling the problem; adding
constraints to the model at the outset; and adding constraints during
search to prevent symmetric assignments being ex- plored on
backtracking. The most successful strategy for the problem of this
paper employs a complex model with less inherent symmetry than the
others, combined with symmetry breaking during search.}

abstract = {
Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) detection plays an important role in computational biology, with applications in gene  nding and gene regulation. The sites are often modeled by gapless pro les, also known as position-weight matrices. Past research has focused on the signi cance of pro le scores (the ability to avoid false positives), but this alone is not enough: The pro le must also possess the power to detect the true positive signals. Several completed genomes are now available, and the search for TFBSs is moving to a large scale; so discriminating signal from noise becomes even more challenging. Since TFBS pro les are usually estimated from only a few experimentally con rmed instances, careful regularization is an important issue. We present a novel method that is well suited for this situation. We further develop measures that help in judging pro le quality, based on both sensitivity and selectivity of a pro le. It is shown that these quality measures can be e ciently computed, and we propose statistically well-founded methods to choose score thresholds. Our  ndings are applied to the TRANSFAC database of transcription factor binding sites. The results are disturbing: If we insist on a signi cance level of 5% in sequences of length 500, only 19% of the pro les detect a true signal instance with 95% success probability under varying background sequence compositions.

abstract= {An important problem in sequence analysis is to discover patterns matching subsets of a given 
 set of bio-sequences. When a pattern common to a subset is found, the quality of the match should 
 be evaluated. This paper proposes that an evaluation scheme for measuring the quality of a match 
 between a sequence set and a common pattern should take into account both the strength of the pattern
 and the diversity of the sequences matched. A pattern matching a diverse set of sequences 
 (i.e., having low degree of similarity) should get a higher score than an equally strong pattern 
 matching a set of more similar sequences. This will avoid sets of very similar sequences from biasing
 the score of the patterns. Ideally a measure of statistical significance of a match taking sequence 
 diversity into account, should be defined. As this is a non-trivial problem, this paper proposes 
 a non-statistical scoring scheme. Ideal requirements for such a scoring scheme are given. It is 
 assumed that the strength of a pattern and the diversity of the sequence set can be evaluated 
 independently, and combined into a total score for the match. We use a restricted class of 
 PROSITE-like patterns, and an earlier reported method for evaluating pattern strength. 
 Two alternative schemes for evaluating the diversity of a set of sequences are proposed: 
 one based on the sum of edge lengths in an estimated phylogenetic tree for the set of sequences, 
 and one based on the minimum weight spanning tree on the graph of all pairwise distances between 
 sequences. For both cases, algorithms and practical application cases are given. 
 The combined measures are shown to have useful properties for a set of test cases.

     As of this writing, the automatic recognition of spontaneous speech

is fraught with errors; many systems transcribe one out of every

one error in
twenty words or better. This high error rate is due in part to the
poor modeling of
pronunciations within spontaneous speech. This dissertation examines
how pronunciations
vary in this speaking style, and how speaking rate and word
predictability
can be used to predict when greater pronunciation variation can be
expected. It includes
an investigation of the relationship between speaking rate, word
predictability,
pronunciations, and errors made by speech recognition systems. The
results of these
studies suggest that for spontaneous speech, it may be appropriate to
build models
for syllables and words that can dynamically change the

  inside-outside algorithm, which was previously proposed to train
  SCFGs. This method is tested on the family of transfer RNA (tRNA)
  sequences. The results show that the model is able to reliab ly

  abstract =	 {Several algorithms for pattern discovery in sequences have recently emerged, such as Pratt, Teiresias, Splash, and Meme. These are proving useful in biological sequences analysis, as the presence of statistically or biologically significant patterns may indicate subtle relationships that complement those discovered through local sequence alignment tools such as BLAST or FASTA [1, 10]. Statistical tools to assess the statistical relevance of maximal, non-contiguous data patterns are still largely undeveloped [9]. Rather, most recent efforts [8] have concentrated on the analysis of the statistical relevance of contiguous k-tuple repeats. The goal of this paper, then, is twofold. First statistical analysis tools are developed to determine how likely arbitrary, non-contiguous data patterns are to occur in random proteins and genomes. This is accomplished by modeling the various properties of pattern discovery algorithms such as pattern maximality and pattern density constraints. Second, a framework is proposed to pinpoint the truly relevant patterns, among the very large number that occur even in small biological datasets. By relevant, in this context, we mean those patterns that reflect a relevant underlying stochastic or deterministic process that deviates from totally random behavior. Some biological examples are studied. In the first one, patterns are extracted from two proteins (HUMPRCA and MUSHEPGFA). By comparing the results with the theoretical analysis, it is determined that all the patterns discovered in HUMPCRA are statistically irrelevant while a few patterns in MUSHEPGFA are significant. In particular, one of these is likely to occur only once every comparable sequences. An indication that this pattern may be biologically relevant is given by the fact that it includes a known motif, reported in the PROSITE database. In the second example, we analyze a region of DNA of 1000 nucleotides from yeast chromosome 1. Only 6 of the discovered patterns are statistically significant and they all occur in a tandem repeat region.}

                  foldings of an RNA molecule have mainly been
                  restricted to energy minimization over all feasible
                  secondary structures. In order to develop more
                  specific analyses, we split up the traditional
                  dynamic programming approach into a structure
                  recognition and an evaluation phase. Regular tree
                  grammars are used to describe the recognized class
                  of structures. This allows to analyse for presence
                  (or even absence) of very specific structures in the
                  folding space of an RNA molecule. An EBNF-like
                  notation for tree grammars is developed. It turns
                  into a recognizer by interpreting the EBNF-operators
                  as parser combinators; the polynomial efficiency of
                  dynamic programming is regained by the introduction
                  of tabulating yield parsers.}

we discretize the problem in two ways. One is surface discretization
and the other is space
discretization. We start searching a good candidate for the matching
in the discretized six
dimensional parameter space at coarse resolution and continue the
searching at finer resolutions
successively. Since molecular surface is complicated, we approximate
the surface by uniformly
sampling dots on the real surface. In order to realize the surface
matching, we use an analogue
of the Hough Transform which has been used in the field of computer
vision. When surfaces
are smooth or piecewise smooth, our method works reasonably well. We

formulated, this problem is undecidable, even when the underlying
alphabet has only 2 symbols (e.g. two of the bases A,C,G,T).
We prove that asexual evolutionary systems form a universal
computation engine, in the sense that for any
reversible
Turing machine $M$ and input $x$, there is a finite set $K$ of lethal genes,
which can guide the computation, so that all intermediate genomes
are prefixes of (encodings of) configurations in the computation of $M$.
Since reversible Turing machines retain the history of
their entire computation, and are essentially encoded by evolutionary systems,
this
suggests a encoding

We examine the static properties of a homogeneous RNA-model that includes pairing and base stacking energies as well as entropic costs for internal loops. For large enough costs the model exhibits a thermal denaturation transition which we analyze in terms of the radius of gyration. We point out an inconsistency in the standard approach to RNA secondary structure prediction for large molecules. Under an external force a second order phase transition between a globular and an extended phase takes place. A Harris-type criterion shows that sequence disorder does not affect the correlation length exponent while the other critical exponents are modified in the glass phase. However, at high temperatures, on a coarse-grained level, disordered RNA is well described by a homogeneous model. The characteristics of force-extension curves are discussed as a function of the energy parameters. We show that the force transition is always second order. A re-entrance phenomenon relevant for real disordered RNA is predicted.}

 In this short note, we prove the time complexity of full-bucket and mini-bucket elimination [1, 2]. In previous papers, when discussing the complexity of these algorithms, only the importance of the exponential contribution was emphasized and the rest of the contributions to the cost were not carefully considered. In this note, we address this fact and provide a non-trivial bound for the non-exponential contribution to the complexity of both algorithms. We demonstrate the result for the Additive Combinatorial Optimization Problem case.

abstract = {
Redundant gene functions are ubiquitous, and they are a potentially important source of evolutionary innovations on the biochemical level. It is therefore highly desirable to understand the mechanisms governing their evolution. Gene duplication is clearly a prominent mechanism generating redundant genes. However, because redundancy provides a protective effect against deleterious mutations, natural selection might be involved in generating and maintaining partial redundancy. Although much experimental data on redundant genes has been accumulated, no data is available that could elucidate what role selection has in their evolution. As a first step towards answering this question, a conceptually simple mathematical model for the evolution of redundancy is introduced. Its main result is that selection can not only maintain, but also increase redundancy among genes in a population provided (i) that mutation generates sufficient variation in redundancy, and (ii) that populations are large. The population biological process at work is somewhat unusual. Selection does not act on the (non-existing) differential fitness between individuals with different degrees of redundancy. Rather, it acts through the low number of offspring with deleterious mutations that individuals with redundant genes will generate. Moreover, even if populations are small and variation in redundancy is low, selection will substantially slow the "decay" of redundancy caused by mutation and genetic drift. Methodological problems in determining degrees of redundancy experimentally are discussed, as well as issues concerning the relation of redundancy to genetic canalization. The latter two phenomena necessitate a differentiated view of neutral mutations necessary, where some neutral mutations are only neutral because their effects on gene products are absorbed by the epigenetic system.

                  end, one often invokes two simple facts: (i) Any

                  induces on its leaves (which represent the

                  characterized by their property of being additive
                  or, in the case of dated rooted trees,
                  ultra-additive. Consequently, searching for additive
                  or ultra-additive metrics A that best approximate
                  the metric D encoding the observed similarities is a
                  standard task in phylogenetic analysis. Remarkably,
                  while there are e cient algorithms for constructing

                  of finding optimal additive approximations in the l1

                  of delta-hyperbolic groups, however, good additive

  abstract =     {We present a probabilistic clustering method defining
                  the clustering task as induction of hidden parameters
                  of a probability model on dyadic linguistic
                  data. Induction of unobserved class parameters is
                  accomplished as statistical inference in the framework
                  of maximum-likelihood estimation from incomplete data
                  via the EM algorithm. We present illustrative examples
                  of induced clusters from large sets of English and
                  German data. The clustering models are evalutated on a
                  pseudo-disambiguation task testing the power of the
                  models to generalize over unseen data. We present two
                  applications of the clustering models to natural
                  language processing applications. The first task
                  concerns the induction of semantic labels for
                  subcategorization slots of English and German lexical
                  verbs. Based on induced clusters of subcategorization
                  frames and their nominal fillers, induction of labels
                  of the respective slots is accomplished by a further
                  application of EM. We report experiments with large
                  sets of German and English intransitive and transitive
                  verbs and outline a linguistic interpretation of the
                  learned representations. A second application concerns
                  the use of clustering models on English verb-noun
                  combinations to select among candidate English
                  translations of German nouns. We present an evaluation
                  of clustering models on a pseudo-disambiguation task
                  for noun-ambiguity. Furthermore, we evaluate the
                  models on a gold standard extracted from a bilingual
                  corpus. The performace of cluster-based
                  target-language disambiguation is reported for models
                  of various sizes and compared to simpler statistical
                  disambiguation methods.},

  abstract =	 {Amorphous computing is the development of
                  organizational principles and programming languages
                  for obtaining coherent behavior from the cooperation
                  of myriads of unreliable parts that are
                  interconnected in unknown, irregular, and
                  time-varying ways. The impetus for amorphous
                  computing comes from developments in
                  microfabrication and fundamental biology, each of
                  which is the basis of a kernel technology that makes
                  it possible to build or grow huge numbers of
                  almost-identical information-processing units at
                  almost no cost. This paper sets out a research
                  agenda for realizing the potential of amorphous
                  computing and surveys some initial progress, both in
                  programming and in fabrication. We describe some
                  approaches to programming amorphous systems, which
                  are inspired by metaphors from biology and
                  physics. We also present the basic ideas of cellular
                  computing, an approach to constructing digital-logic
                  circuits within living cells by representing logic
                  levels by concentrations DNA-binding proteins. }

                 several types; each type recognizes certain other ones.
                 Recognition events result either in processor state
                 change or a 2-processor swap. Model combines cellular
                 automaton and connectionist featrures with
                 probabilistic computation. Intended application:
                 representation and computation of metaphors.",

                 d\&apos;ordre sup\&eacute;rieur, notion d\&apos;instant
                 global et r\&eacute;activit\&eacute;. La
                 s\&eacute;mantique formelle du langage est
                 donn\&eacute;e en utilisant deux formalismes\&tilde;:
                 le \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calcul et
                 l\&apos;approche par \&laquo;machine chimique\&raquo;
                 (\&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;). Ces formalismes sont
                 tous deux assez puissants pour exprimer la
                 cr\&eacute;ation dynamique et les param\&egrave;tres
                 d\&apos;ordre sup\&eacute;rieur, mais ils donnent des
                 visions diff\&eacute;rentes du noyau du langage. En
                 \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calcul, l\&apos;accent est
                 mis sur la communication \&agrave; travers des canaux,
                 tandis qu\&apos;en \&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;, il
                 est mis sur les interactions de plus haut niveau entre
                 les composants parall\&egrave;les. On prouve finalement
                 l\&apos;ad\&eacute;quation de la s\&eacute;mantique en
                 \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calcul par rapport
                 \&agrave; celle en \&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;. We
                 are studying semantics of a small object-based
                 language, with the following main characteristics:
                 parallelism, dynamicity, high order parameters, notion
                 of a global instant, and reactivity. We give formal
                 semantics using two related formalisms , namely
                 \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calculus and the so-called
                 \&laquo;Chemical Abstract Machine\&raquo;
                 (\&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;). These formalisms are
                 both powerful enough to express dynamicity and high
                 order parameters, but they give distinct insights into
                 the language. In \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calculus,
                 emphasis is put on communications through channels; on
                 the other hand, in \&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;,
                 emphasis is put on more abstract and general
                 interactions between program parts. We finally prove
                 adequacy of the \&dollar;\&bsol;pi\&dollar;-calculus
                 semantics w.r.t. the \&bsol;Name\&lcub;CHAM\&rcub;
