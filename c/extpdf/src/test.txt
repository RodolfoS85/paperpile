Abstract
Background: The genome of the avian adenovirus Chicken Embryo Lethal Orphan (CELO) has
two terminal regions without detectable homology in mammalian adenoviruses that are left
without annotation in the initial analysis. Since adenoviruses have been a rich source of new insights
into molecular cell biology and practical applications of CELO as gene a delivery vector are being
considered, this genome appeared worth revisiting. We conducted a systematic reannotation and
in-depth sequence analysis of the CELO genome.
Results: We describe a strongly diverged paralogous cluster including ORF-2, ORF-12, ORF-13,
and ORF-14 with an ATPase/helicase domain most likely acquired from adeno-associated
parvoviruses. None of these ORFs appear to have retained ATPase/helicase function and
alternative functions (e.g. modulation of gene expression during the early life-cycle) must be
considered in an adenoviral context. Further, we identified a cluster of three putative type-1-
transmembrane glycoproteins with IG-like domains (ORF-9, ORF-10, ORF-11) which are good
candidates to substitute for the missing immunomodulatory functions of mammalian adenoviruses.
ORF-16 (located directly adjacent) displays distant homology to vertebrate mono-ADP-
ribosyltransferases. Members of this family are known to be involved in immuno-regulation and
similiar functions during CELO life cycle can be considered for this ORF. Finally, we describe a
putative triglyceride lipase (merged ORF-18/19) with additional domains, which can be expected to
have specific roles during the infection of birds, since they are unique to avian adenoviruses and
Marek's disease-like viruses, a group of pathogenic avian herpesviruses.
Conclusions: We could characterize most of the previously unassigned ORFs pointing to
functions in host-virus interaction. The results provide new directives for rationally designed
experiments.
Background
Chicken embryo lethal orphan virus (CELO) is an adeno-
virus infecting avian species [1,2]. It is a member of the
genus Aviadenovirus and also referred to as Fowl Adenovi-
rus 1 (FAdV-1). Compared to mammalian and, in partic-
ular, human adenoviruses of the genus Mastadenovirus,
which have been studied extensively over the years
(reviewed in [3]), relatively little information is available

on avian adenoviruses. In 1996, CELO was the first virus
of this group to be completely sequenced [4].
The analysis of the sequence revealed that the central por-
tion of the 43.8 kb long, double-stranded, linear DNA
genome is organized similar to mammalian adenoviruses.
Genes for the major structural proteins (e.g. IIIa, hexon,
penton base) as well as crucial functional proteins (e.g.
DNA-polymerase, protease) are well conserved with
respect to amino acid sequence and location. However,
the important E1A, E1B, E3 and E4 regions, mainly
responsible for host cell interaction and immune modula-
tion/evasion in mammalian adenoviruses, could not be
identified. Instead, two unique terminal regions of about
6 kb and 12 kb rich in open reading frames with no
homologs in mammalian adenoviruses could be found.
This surprising result suggests that the basic properties of
the replication cycle are similar in both groups whereas
they encode a completely different set of proteins for host
interaction. Only a few of these proteins have been func-
tionally characterized so far.
ORF-1 is significantly homologous to dUTP-pyrophos-
phatases and was reported to have this enzymatic activity
[4]. ORF-1 is the only sequence in the terminal regions
which has homologs in mastadenoviruses (ORF-1 of early
region 4). In human adenovirus 9, this protein has
growth-transforming properties and is an important
oncogenic determinant [5].
ORF-8, which has been designated Gam1, is probably the
most intriguing protein found in CELO. Originally identi-
fied as a novel antiapoptotic protein [6] and further
shown to induce heat shock response necessary for repli-
cation [7], it is now known to influence host gene expres-
sion by inactivation of histone deacetylase 1 [4,8,9].
Together with another unique protein (ORF-22), Gam1
influences also the pRb/E2F pathway crucial for cell-cycle
progression. Both proteins bind pRb and, thus, act as
functional analogs of the prominent adenoviral E1A pro-
tein [10].
For the rest of the unique ORFs, experimental data is
sparse if available at all. Mutational studies found most of
them to be dispensable for viral replication under differ-
ent experimental settings [11,12]. In an attempt to charac-
terize the transcriptional organisation of CELO, the
corresponding RNAs for some of the ORFs together with
their expression kinetics could be identified [13]. How-
ever, the functions of these proteins during the viral life
cycle are still completely unknown. Since they are thought
to be implicated in such critical areas of biology as for
example cell cycle control and immune response to viral
infections, these proteins are of special interest. Moreover,
CELO has been considered for use as a gene delivery vec-
tor with promising features for both human gene therapy
and vaccination applications in aviculture [11,12,14]. A
better understanding of CELO biology could help to pro-
mote such applications.
In this contribution, we report a complete, systematic, in-
depth sequence analysis of all potential coding sequences
in the CELO genome. Applying a relevant subset of the
most advanced analyzing methods available at present,
we determined the molecular architecture of the putative
proteins and uncovered distant homologies, evolutionary
relationships and possible molecular and cellular func-
tions. If available, we also analyzed homologous
sequences of closely related avian adenoviruses. These are
(i) Fowl Adenovirus 9 (FAdV-9, formerly known in litera-
ture as FAdV-8) [15-17], (ii) strain CFA40, a hypervirulent
variant of FAdV-9 [18] and (iii) FAdV-10. For FAdV-9, the
complete genomic sequence is available, for CFA40 and
FAdV-10 only fragments of the nucleic acid sequence are
known. We anticipate that our results will stimulate exper-
imental studies of CELO ORFs with newly assigned
molecular and/or cellular functions.
Results
Refinement and analysis of potential coding regions
The complete CELO sequence has been analyzed upon its
initial sequencing [4]. In the central region ranging from
approximately nt 6000 to 31000, most of the ORFs could
be reliably assigned to proteins that have been previously
described for mastadenoviruses. In the terminal regions
(appr. nt 0–6000 and 31000–43804) no sequence simi-
larity to known adenoviral sequences could be detected
on the nucleic acid or protein level. Originally, 22 poten-
tial protein coding sequences were proposed to reside in
the unique terminal regions [4]. They have found their
way into public databases and are referred to throughout
literature. Those putative proteins are exclusively ORFs
which are longer than 99 amino acids and start with a
methionine. This is a rather arbitrary approach and, since
also the experimental studies fall short in detecting and
characterizing all RNAs of these regions [13], we had to
refine the prediction of protein coding regions in order
not to miss important information due to wrong concep-
tual translations. We did a complete retranslation of the
genome in all six frames also considering ORFs shorter
than 99 amino acids and without a starting methionine,
we further compared the potential coding regions to the
related avian adenoviruses, especially to the complete
genome of FAdV-9, and integrated all available experi-
mental data [13,15-17] as well as the results of our subse-
quent protein sequence analysis. Table 1 and Fig. 1 list the
most likely coding regions that could be identified. If pos-
sible, we adhere to the nomenclature introduced by Chi-
occa et al. [4].
