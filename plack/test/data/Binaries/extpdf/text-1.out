information

The genomic organization of the human genes that encode
protein prenyltransferases is shown in Figure 1. It is interesting

Automatic comparisons of data from expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) with genes (for example using the program
Acembly, for which the results are available from the NCBI
AceView server [2]) shows that all the human protein
prenyltransferase genes have multiple alternative splice variants. The extent of translation of the various predicted transcripts and the structures and functions of the resulting
proteins remain to be established experimentally; some of
the predicted transcripts may be derived from missplicing
rather than being real splice variants.

interactions

Protein prenylation is the posttranslational attachment of
either a farnesyl group or a geranylgeranyl group via a
thioether linkage (-C-S-C-) to a cysteine at or near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Farnesyl and geranylgeranyl
groups are polyisoprenes, unsaturated hydrocarbons with a
multiple of five carbons; the chain is 15 carbons long in the
farnesyl moiety and 20 carbons long in the geranylgeranyl
moiety (see Table 1). There are three different protein
prenyltransferases in humans: farnesyltransferase (FT) and
geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) share the same motif
(the CaaX box) around the cysteine in their substrates, and
are thus called CaaX prenyltransferases, whereas geranylgeranyltransferase 2 (GGT2, also called Rab geranylgeranyltransferase) recognizes a different motif and is thus called a
non-CaaX prenyltransferase [1]. Each protein consists of two
subunits, ␣ and ␤; the ␣ subunit of FT and GGT1 is encoded
by the same gene, FNTA (see Table 1).

to note that the genes encoding both subunits of non-CaaX
prenyltransferases are much smaller (about 6-9 kilobases,
kb) than those of the CaaX prenyltransferases (about 30-76
kb). The number of exons in the two types of genes are
similar; the differences in gene size therefore result from differing intron lengths.

Gene organization and evolutionary history

deposited research

Three different protein prenyltransferases (farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferases I and
II) catalyze the attachment of prenyl lipid anchors 15 or 20 carbons long to the carboxyl termini of
a variety of eukaryotic proteins. Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I both recognize
a ‘Ca1a2X’ motif on their protein substrates; geranylgeranyltransferase II recognizes a different,
non-CaaX motif. Each enzyme has two subunits. The genes encoding CaaX protein
prenyltransferases are considerably longer than those encoding non-CaaX subunits, as a result of
longer introns. Alternative splice forms are predicted to occur, but the extent to which each splice
form is translated and the functions of the different resulting isoforms remain to be established.
Farnesyltransferase-inhibitor drugs have been developed as anti-cancer agents and may also be able
to treat several other diseases. The effects of these inhibitors are complicated, however, by the
overlapping substrate specificities of geranylgeranyltransferase I and farnesyltransferase.

including several parasites. The chromosomal locations and
number of exons from protein prenyltransferase genes in
the major eukaryotic model organisms are shown in
Table 2. The ␣ and ␤ subunits have different folds, so are
unlikely to have arisen from a common ancestor. Molecular
phylogenetic analysis shows that orthologous proteins in
different species are more closely related to each other than
to their paralogs in the same species; the relationships
between the ␤ subunits are not fully clear. As well as the
known genes, processed pseudogenes resulting from retrotransposition events have been found in the human and
mouse genomes [3,4].
The ␣ subunits of protein prenyltransferases consist of tetratricopeptide repeats and are part of the tetratricopeptide
repeat superfamily [5], which also includes functionally
diverse proteins involved in transcription, co-chaperoning,
protein transport, cell-cycle control and phosphorylation.
Although evolution of repeat proteins is difficult to analyze
and interpret, Zhang and Grishin [6] have deduced convincingly that the FNTA and RABGGTA genes originated from a
common ancestor that already contained multiple tetratricopeptide repeats rather than having independently amplified
the number of motifs as the families diverged over time.
The evolutionary history of the ␤ subunits of protein prenyltransferases has received much less attention so far than that
of the ␣ subunits [7]. They can, however, be shown using

standard sequence analysis tools such as PSI-Blast [8] or
HMMer [9] to be part of a superfamily of prenyltransferases.
Whereas the ␤ subunits of protein prenyltransferases attach
lipid anchors to proteins, other members of the superfamily
catalyze different reactions involving polyisoprenes, such as
the cyclization of polyisoprene derivatives during the synthesis of hopanoids in bacteria [10], cycloartenol in plants [11],
ergosterol in fungi [12] and lanosterol in vertebrates [13,14];
these products are then generally processed further to
produce essential substances such as cholesterol, steroid
hormones or vitamin D and their equivalents. A merged
PFAM [15] domain (PF00432) has been created containing
the ␤ subunits of protein prenyltransferases, as well as squalene-hopene cyclases and lanosterol and cycloartenol synthases. Intriguingly, structural superposition of the
conserved (␣-␣)6 barrel forming one half of bacterial squalene-hopene cyclase (the enzyme that synthesizes
hopanoids) [16] with the ␤ subunit of rat FT [17] reveals correspondence not only of their secondary structural elements
but also of the parts of their active or binding sites
(Figure 2). This would make sense if the different enzymes
have retained common reaction mechanisms - or at least
common substrate-binding characteristics - during evolution. Indeed, all of the members of the prenyltransferase
superfamily bind substrates containing isoprenyl units,
although they bind different numbers and variations of such
units and the underlying processing and binding mechanisms seem to have diverged widely over time.

The CaaX prenyltransferases FT and GGT1 and the non-CaaX
prenyltransferase GGT2 share the same heterodimeric structure [1] (Figure 3). In the ␣ subunits of both types of protein
prenyltransferases, seven tetratricopeptide repeats are
formed by pairs of helices (helices 2 to 15) that are stabilized

It is difficult to estimate the effect of alternative splicing on
the structure of protein prenyltransferases. We would
expect that the integrity of the structure of the ␤ subunits
would be more sensitive to non-terminal truncations than
are the ␣ subunits, because the modular structure of the

by conserved intercalating residues. The ␣ subunits of GGT2
in mammals and plants also have an immunoglobulin-like
domain between the fifth and sixth tetratricopeptide repeat,
as well as leucine-rich repeats at the carboxyl terminus. The
functions of these additional domains in GGT2 are as yet
undefined, but they are apparently not directly involved in
the interaction with substrates and Rab escort proteins (see
below) [18,19]. The tetratricopeptide repeats of the ␣ subunit
form a right-handed superhelix, which embraces the (␣-␣)6
barrel of the ␤ subunit [20]. The ␤ subunits include most of
the substrate- and lipid-binding pockets [20] and their tight
association with the respective ␣ subunits is required for
proper function [21]. Compared with FT, GGT2 has a larger
hydrophobic pocket in the ␤ subunit to accommodate the
longer lipid [22].

information

GGT2 recognizes the structural features of a complex of the
substrate with an escort protein (Rab escort protein (REP),

Lipid anchors are common posttranslational modifications
that can direct the subcellular localization of proteins. Other
lipid modifications, such as myristoylation [36-38], palmitoylation [39,40] and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchors [41,42], are mainly important for attachment of the
protein to membranes, but lipid modification by protein
prenyltransferases seems to have a more complex role: the
farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties attached to the substrates are directly involved in protein-protein interactions
as well as in protein-membrane interactions [43]. The
importance of protein prenyltransferases is illustrated by the

interactions

In contrast to FT and GGT1, GGT2 does not require a very
specific carboxy-terminal motif [30] apart from the availability of several cysteines close to the carboxyl terminus
that are often arranged -CC, -CXC, -CCX, -CCXX, -CCXXX
or, in a few cases, with only a single cysteine as in -CXXX. If
the motif consists of two cysteines in close proximity, two
geranylgeranyl moieties are usually added.

As the ␣ subunit of CaaX prenyltransferases is shared
between FT and GGT1, its expression must be higher than
that of each ␤ subunit if it is to form 1:1 complexes with the ␤
subunits of both enzymes. These higher expression levels
seem to be transcriptionally regulated by different promoters; in order to produce recombinant CaaX prenyltransferases in the laboratory, it is thus necessary to
downregulate expression of the ␣ subunits when coexpressing with ␤ subunits [35].

refereed research

CaaX prenyltransferases recognize the carboxy-terminal
Ca1a2X motif (see Table 1) [23,24] of substrate proteins,
usually after binding farnesyl-pyrophosphate [25] or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate [26]. The lipid anchors are then
transferred by a catalytic mechanism that depends on formation of a complex between a Zn2+ cation and the cysteine
of the Ca1a2X motif [20]. High concentrations of Mg2+ are
required for optimal enzymatic activity of FT [27], though
this is apparently not the case for GGT1 [28]. The Zn2+ is
suggested to be required for the proper conformation of the
substrate peptide [17]. The major conformational change in
the transfer step seems to be a rotation of the prenylpyrophosphate in the binding pocket and not of parts of the
enzyme itself. A detailed picture of the reaction pathway that
involves electrophilic and nucleophilic mechanisms is given
by a series of structures representing the different states [28]
as well as by kinetic measurements [29].

The results of systematic oligonucleotide microarray experiments catalogued in the human gene-expression index
database [33,34] show that protein prenyltransferases are
expressed in a variety of tissues. Both CaaX prenyltransferases seem to be active (that is, their ␣ and ␤ subunits are
coexpressed) in a range of tissues, and the non-CaaX
prenyltransferase subunits are also expressed in several
more tissues. It should be noted, however, that many of the
expression levels listed [33,34] are close to the detection
threshold and could therefore result from cross-hybridization between close homologs rather than true expression.
Interestingly, the ␣ subunits also appear to be expressed in
tissues that lack expression of the corresponding ␤ subunits; this suggests that single subunits, or isoforms of
them, might have additional, prenylation-independent
functions in the cell.

previously known as component A) and then scans the
carboxyl terminus for prenylatable cysteines [30]. The
catalytic mechanism of lipid transfer from geranylgeranylpyrophosphate to the protein substrate also requires Zn2+,
and the following model has been presented for how the
double geranylgeranylation could take place on the basis of
insights from the reaction pathway of FT [28]. After attachment of the first prenyl group, the lipid chain is translocated
over the enzyme surface into another hydrophobic groove
upon binding of the second geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate.
Finally, binding of a third geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate
releases the whole complex of the now doubly geranylgeranylated substrate with its escort protein; the escort
protein is also involved in the transport of the substrate to
the target membrane [31,32].

Farnesyltransferase

(a)

Substrates and functions of CaaX prenyltransferases

Because several prenylated substrates are involved in diseases, inhibition of protein prenyltransferases has great
potential for medical applications. A boom in the field was
triggered by the finding that inhibition of FT in mice that
have tumors derived from H-Ras-transformed cells leads to
tumor regression, while the inhibitor has no adverse effect
on the organism [49]. This led to successful completion of
clinical phase I trials of farnesyl transferase inhibitors
(FTIs), but in phase II trials the efficacy of the inhibitors
towards a broad spectrum of different cancer cells (such as
K-Ras-transformed cells) was far below the high expectations that arose from the phase I trials. Surprisingly,
however, beneficial effects were found for other, nonneoplastic diseases; for example, diabetic retinopathy and
macular degeneration [50]. The unexpected physiological
effects of FT inhibition are partly due to a striking crossspecificity between the two CaaX prenyltransferases: both
FT and GGT1 can use either farnesyl-pyrophosphate or
GGPP to a certain extent to transfer lipids to several of each
others’ substrates as well as their own [51,52], and several
substrates can be either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated.
The substrates probably compete in vivo for the enzymes
loaded with the preferred polyprenyl-pyrophosphate, and
the type of modification that is added depends on the relative affinity of the substrates for the enzymes.
In cancer cells, FTIs are known to affect growth in soft agar

Typical substrates that are farnesylated by FT include many
members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (H-Ras,
K-Ras, N-Ras, Ras2, Rap2, RhoB (which is also geranylgeranylated), RhoE, Rheb, TC10, and TC21), as well as the
nuclear lamina proteins lamin A and B, the kinetochore proteins CENP-E and CENP-F, fungal mating factors, cGMP
phosphodiesterase ␣, ␥ subunit variants of G proteins, DnaJ
heat-shock protein homologs, rhodopsin kinase, the peroxisomal membrane proteins Pex19 and PxF and paralemmin
(a neural protein suggested to be involved in membrane
dynamics). GGT1 preferentially geranylgeranylates some of
the other small GTPases (such as Rac1, Rac2, RalA, Rap1A,
Rap1B, RhoA, and RhoB (which is also farnesylated, as
noted above), RhoC, Cdc42, Rab8 (which is also geranylgeranylated by GGT2), Rab11, and Rab13, as well as some
␥-subunit variants of G proteins, cGMP phosphodiesterase ␤
and the plant calmodulin CaM53. Typically, prenylation by
CaaX protein prenyltransferases is accompanied by further
posttranslational processing, most often involving cleavage
of the carboxy-terminal tripeptide (-a1a2X) followed by carboxymethylation of the carboxyl terminus [45-47]. Palmitoylation is another modification that sometimes takes place
after prenylation [48].

induction of apoptosis. The substrate proteins that have
been suggested to be involved in these effects include H-Ras
[49], Rheb [53], CENP-E [54] and RhoB [55]; FTI effects are
reviewed in more detail elsewhere [56]. The effects of FT
inhibition in cells transformed with H-Ras differ from those
on cells transformed with K-Ras. This difference has been
attributed to the ability of GGT1 to alternatively prenylate
some proteins, through the cross-specificity mentioned
above, including K-Ras but not H-Ras (see Figure 4). RhoB
can be both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated; Prendergast and colleagues [57] have suggested that the different
levels of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated RhoB in FTItreated cells compared with untreated cells could contribute
to the observed effects of FTIs.

interactions

A third issue is the striking differences in gene size and
intron length between the two types of protein prenyltransferases. One of several possible factors that could have
caused this is a difference in evolutionary selection pressures. Whereas FT and GGT1 partly compensate each other
functionally, there is no counterpart for GGT2. Furthermore,
formation of a complex between the substrate and an escort
protein is necessary for recognition by GGT2 and the conservation of additional binding sites at the surface is therefore
required. Also, the severity of the effect when the prenylation
of different substrates is abolished may vary. Finally, the size

There are several issues that merit further study in the regulation of protein prenyltransferases. Firstly, it is not clear
how the concomitant transcription of the two subunits
from two different chromosomes is regulated or where and
how the subunits meet to build up functional prenyltransferases. Secondly, given that there are multiple splice variants, it is likely that additional variants of subunits will be
found to have distinct functions or regulatory roles; an
example is a variant of the FT/GGT1 ␣ subunit that has
been reported to be directly involved in signaling by transforming growth factor ␤ and activin [65]. Interpretation of
results in areas ranging from molecular biology to clinical
trials must take into account possible isoforms with
varying functions or altered interactions to avoid erroneous conclusions.

deposited research

Finally, more research is also needed on the effects of FTIs.
After the rush to develop inhibitors, basic research is now
needed as well as clinical trials in order to improve the
understanding of the basic processes involved [66]. For
example, it cannot be ruled out that some effects of FTIs are
not a direct consequence of inhibiting prenylation but are
instead due to cross-reactivity with proteins from completely
different pathways. It is tempting to speculate that one of the
proteins that are evolutionarily related to the protein prenyltransferases (such as other prenyltransferases) could be
affected by FTIs; the selectivity of existing FTIs, which do
not inhibit even the much more closely related GGTs, makes
this scenario most unlikely, however. The next task is to
identify clearly the proteins whose altered prenylation
causes the observed effects of FT inhibition. Given the multiplicity and heterogeneity of these effects, it is clear that they
cannot be attributed to one single farnesylated protein that
lacks a lipid modification because of FT inhibition; rather,
alterations in the function of several proteins probably cause
the observed effects, with variations depending on the cell
type, disease and organism. Further research may eventually
lead to FTIs being used successfully to treat cancers and
other diseases.

reports

As with CaaX protein prenyltransferases, deficiencies in
prenylation by non-CaaX protein prenyltransferases are relevant to diseases [59,60]. A mutation inactivating a start
codon of the major transcript of the ␣ subunit of GGT2 is
one of the many mutations involved in the recessively inherited Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and related disorders
[61,62], in which platelet synthesis, platelet organelle function and pigmentation are affected. X-linked choroideremia
(CHM) results in retinal degeneration, with symptoms starting from night blindness in young people and progressing
over decades until vision is completely lost [63]. It is caused
by loss-of-function mutations in the CHM gene, which
encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1) [64]. Loss-of function
mutations in the Rab27a gene cause Griscelli syndrome,
whose symptoms are similar to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and other diseases associated with insufficient Rab
prenylation [60].

be affected by expression levels. The implications of these
factors for the exact evolutionary history of the protein
prenyltransferase genes (such as the relative ages of the subunits and the order of duplication events) remain to be
established.

comment

Ras superfamily. There are at least 60 different Rabs in
humans [58]. They interact with the Rab escort protein REP,
which is required for the prenylation of Rabs by GGT2 [30],
and are involved in the docking of transport vesicles to their
specific target membranes [59].
