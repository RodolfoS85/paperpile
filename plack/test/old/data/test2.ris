TI  - Structural profiles of human miRNA families from pairwise clustering.
JO  - Bioinformatics
AB  - MicroRNAs are a group of small, approximately 21nt long, riboregulators inhibiting gene expression at a posttranscriptional level. Their most distinctive structural feature is the foldback hairpin of their precursor pre-miRNAs. Even though each pre-miRNA deposited in miRBase has its secondary structure already predicted, little is known about the patterns of structural conservation among pre-miRNAs. We address this issue by clustering the human pre-miRNA sequences based on pairwise, sequence and secondary structure alignment using FOLDALIGN, followed by global multiple alignment of obtained clusters by WAR. As a result, the common secondary structure was successfully determined for four FOLDALIGN clusters: the RF00027 structural family of the Rfam database and three clusters with previously undescribed consensus structures CONTACT: gorodkin@genome.ku.dk.

TI  - Evolution of Spliceosomal snRNA Genes in Metazoan Animals.
JO  - J Mol Evol
AB  - While studies of the evolutionary histories of protein families are commonplace, little is known on noncoding RNAs beyond microRNAs and some snoRNAs. Here we investigate in detail the evolutionary history of the nine spliceosomal snRNA families (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac) across the completely or partially sequenced genomes of metazoan animals. Representatives of the five major spliceosomal snRNAs were found in all genomes. None of the minor splicesomal snRNAs were detected in nematodes or in the shotgun traces of Oikopleura dioica, while in all other animal genomes at most one of them is missing. Although snRNAs are present in multiple copies in most genomes, distinguishable paralogue groups are not stable over long evolutionary times, although they appear independently in several clades. In general, animal snRNA secondary structures are highly conserved, albeit, in particular, U11 and U12 in insects exhibit dramatic variations. An analysis of genomic context of snRNAs reveals that they behave like mobile elements, exhibiting very little syntenic conservation.

TI  - RNAalifold: improved consensus structure prediction for RNA alignments.
JO  - BMC Bioinformatics
SP  - 474
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The prediction of a consensus structure for a set of related RNAs is an important first step for subsequent analyses. RNAalifold, which computes the minimum energy structure that is simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of the oldest and most widely used tools for this task. In recent years, several alternative approaches have been advocated, pointing to several shortcomings of the original RNAalifold approach. RESULTS: We show that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be improved substantially by introducing a different, more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring matrices. These improvements are achieved without compromising the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We show here that the new version of RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one, but also several other tools recently developed, on different datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The new version of RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for almost any application but it is also competitive with other approaches including those based on SCFGs, maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical nearest neighbor classifiers.

TI  - tRNAdb 2009: compilation of tRNA sequences and tRNA genes.
JO  - Nucleic Acids Res
AB  - One of the first specialized collections of nucleic acid sequences in life sciences was the ?compilation of tRNA sequences and sequences of tRNA genes? (http://www.trna.uni-bayreuth.de). Here, an updated and completely restructured version of this compilation is presented (http://trnadb.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de). The new database, tRNAdb, is hosted and maintained in cooperation between the universities of Leipzig, Marburg, and Strasbourg. Reimplemented as a relational database, tRNAdb will be updated periodically and is searchable in a highly flexible and user-friendly way. Currently, it contains more than 12 000 tRNA genes, classified into families according to amino acid specificity. Furthermore, the implementation of the NCBI taxonomy tree facilitates phylogeny-related queries. The database provides various services including graphical representations of tRNA secondary structures, a customizable output of aligned or un-aligned sequences with a variety of individual and combinable search criteria, as well as the construction of consensus sequences for any selected set of tRNAs.

TI  - A Topological Approach to Chemical Organizations.
JO  - Artif Life
AB  - Abstract Large chemical reaction networks often exhibit distinctive features that can be interpreted as higher-level structures. Prime examples are metabolic pathways in a biochemical context. We review mathematical approaches that exploit the stoichiometric structure, which can be seen as a particular directed hypergraph, to derive an algebraic picture of chemical organizations. We then give an alternative interpretation in terms of set-valued set functions that encapsulate the production rules of the individual reactions. From the mathematical point of view, these functions define generalized topological spaces on the set of chemical species. We show that organization-theoretic concepts also appear in a natural way in the topological language. This abstract representation in turn suggests the exploration of the chemical meaning of well-established topological concepts. As an example, we consider connectedness in some detail.

IS  - Pt 10
AB  - Inactivation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) hfq gene, encoding the Sm-like Hfq protein, resulted in pleiotropic effects that included an attenuated virulence. As regulation by Hfq often involves the action of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), we have used a shotgun cloning approach (RNomics) and bioinformatic tools to identify sRNAs in strain PAO1. For cDNA library construction, total RNA was extracted from PAO1 cultures either grown to stationary phase or exposed to human serum. The cDNA libraries were generated from small-sized RNAs of PAO1 after co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq. Of 400 sequenced cDNA clones, 11 mapped to intergenic regions. Band-shift assays and Northern blot analyses performed with two selected sRNAs confirmed that Hfq binds to and affects the steady-state levels of these RNAs. A proteome study performed upon overproduction of one sRNA, PhrS, implicated it in riboregulation. PhrS contains an ORF, and evidence for its translation is presented. In addition, based on surveys with structure-based bioinformatic tools, we provide an electronic compilation of putative sRNA and non-coding RNA genes of PAO1 based on their evolutionarily conserved structure.

TI  - SynBlast: assisting the analysis of conserved synteny information.
JO  - BMC Bioinformatics
SP  - 351
VL  - 9
AB  - MOTIVATION: In the last years more than 20 vertebrate genomes have been sequenced, and the rate at which genomic DNA information becomes available is rapidly accelerating. Gene duplication and gene loss events inherently limit the accuracy of orthology detection based on sequence similarity alone. Fully automated methods for orthology annotation do exist but often fail to identify individual members in cases of large gene families, or to distinguish missing data from traceable gene losses. This situation can be improved in many cases by including conserved synteny information. RESULTS: Here we present the SynBlast pipeline that is designed to construct and evaluate local synteny information. SynBlast uses the genomic region around a focal reference gene to retrieve candidates for homologous regions from a collection of target genomes and ranks them in accord with the available evidence for homology. The pipeline is intended as a tool to aid high quality manual annotation in particular in those cases where automatic procedures fail. We demonstrate how SynBlast is applied to retrieving orthologous and paralogous clusters using the vertebrate Hox and ParaHox clusters as examples.

AB  - The formation of antibodies to interferon-beta (IFN-beta), a protein-based disease-modifying agent for multiple sclerosis (MS), is a problem in clinical practice. These antibodies may neutralize the biological effects of the protein drug, potentially decreasing its therapeutic effects. By high-resolution HLA class I and II typing we identified two HLA class II alleles associated with the development of antibodies to IFN-beta. In two independent continuous and binary-trait association studies, HLA-DRB1*0401 and HLA-DRB1*0408 (odds ratio: 5.15)?but not other HLA alleles?were strongly associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies to IFN-beta. The associated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles differ from nonassociated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles by a glycine-to-valine substitution in position 86 of the epitope-binding alpha-helix of the HLA class II molecule. The peptide-binding motif of HLA-DRB1*0401 and *0408 might promote binding and presentation of an immunogenic peptide, which may eventually break T cell tolerance and facilitate antibody development to IFN-beta. In summary, we identified genetic factors determining the immunogenicity of IFN-beta, a protein-based disease-modifying agent for the treatment of MS.

JO  - Algorithms Mol Biol
SP  - 7
VL  - 3
AB  - MOTIVATION: Sequence-based methods for phylogenetic reconstruction from (nucleic acid) sequence data are notoriously plagued by two effects: homoplasies and alignment errors. Large evolutionary distances imply a large number of homoplastic sites. As most protein-coding genes show dramatic variations in substitution rates that are not uncorrelated across the sequence, this often leads to a patchwork pattern of (i) phylogenetically informative and (ii) effectively randomized regions. In highly variable regions, furthermore, alignment errors accumulate resulting in sometimes misleading signals in phylogenetic reconstruction. RESULTS: We present here a method that, based on assessing the distribution of character states along a cyclic ordering of the taxa, allows the identification of phylogenetically uninformative homoplastic sites in a multiple sequence alignment. Removal of these sites appears to improve the performance of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms as measured by various indices of "tree quality". In particular, we obtain more stable trees due to the exclusion of phylogenetically incompatible sites that most likely represent strongly randomized characters. SOFTWARE: The computer program noisy implements this approach. It can be employed to improving phylogenetic reconstruction capability with quite a considerable success rate whenever (1) the average bootstrap support obtained from the original alignment is low, and (2) there are sufficiently many taxa in the data set - at least, say, 12 to 15 taxa.

AB  - The 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is a key player in the regulation of polymerase (pol) II transcription. The 7SK RNA was long believed to be specific to vertebrates where it is highly conserved. Homologs in basal deuterostomes and a few lophotrochozoan species were only recently reported. On longer timescales, 7SK evolves rapidly with only few conserved sequence and structure motifs. Previous attempts to identify the Drosophila homolog thus have remained unsuccessful despite considerable efforts. Here we report on the discovery of arthropod 7SK RNAs using a novel search strategy based on pol III promoters, as well as the subsequent verification of its expression. Our results demonstrate that a 7SK snRNA featuring 2 highly structured conserved domains was present already in the bilaterian ancestor.

IS  - 1
AB  - Genome-wide multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are a necessary prerequisite for an increasingly diverse collection of comparative genomic approaches. Here we present a versatile method that generates high-quality MSAs for non-protein-coding sequences. The NcDNAlign pipeline combines pairwise BLAST alignments to create initial MSAs, which are then locally improved and trimmed. The program is optimized for speed and hence is particulary well-suited to pilot studies. We demonstrate the practical use of NcDNAlign in three case studies: the search for ncRNAs in gammaproteobacteria and the analysis of conserved noncoding DNA in nematodes and teleost fish, in the latter case focusing on the fate of duplicated ultra-conserved regions. Compared to the currently widely used genome-wide alignment program TBA, our program results in a 20- to 30-fold reduction of CPU time necessary to generate gammaproteobacterial alignments. A showcase application of bacterial ncRNA prediction based on alignments of both algorithms results in similar sensitivity, false discovery rates, and up to 100 putatively novel ncRNA structures. Similar findings hold for our application of NcDNAlign to the identification of ultra-conserved regions in nematodes and teleosts. Both approaches yield conserved sequences of unknown function, result in novel evolutionary insights into conservation patterns among these genomes, and manifest the benefits of an efficient and reliable genome-wide alignment package.

VL  - 379
IS  - 1
AB  - We introduce here a heuristic approach to kinetic RNA folding that constructs secondary structures by stepwise combination of building blocks. These blocks correspond to subsequences and their thermodynamically optimal structures. These are determined by the standard dynamic programming approach to RNA folding. Folding trajectories are modeled at base-pair resolution using the Morgan-Higgs heuristic and a barrier tree-based heuristic to connect combinations of the local building blocks. Implemented in the program Kinwalker, the algorithm allows co-transcriptional folding and can be used to fold sequences of up to about 1500 nucleotides in length. A detailed comparison with several well-studied examples from the literature, including the delayed folding of bacteriophage cloverleaf structures, the adenine sensing riboswitch, and the hok RNA, shows an excellent agreement of predicted trajectories and experimental evidence. The software is available as part of the ViennaRNA Package.

AB  - The amphioxus Hox cluster is often viewed as "archetypal" for the chordate lineage. Here, we present a descriptive account of the 448 kb region spanning the Hox cluster of the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae from Hox14 to Hox1. We provide complete coding sequences of all 14 previously described amphioxus sequences and give a detailed analysis of the conserved noncoding regulatory sequence elements. We find that the posterior part of the Hox cluster is so highly derived that even the complete genomic sequence is insufficient to decide whether the posterior Hox genes arose by independent duplications or whether they are true orthologs of the corresponding gnathostome paralog groups. In contrast, the anterior region is much better conserved. The amphioxus Hox cluster strongly excludes repetitive elements with the exception of two repeat islands in the posterior region. Repeat exclusion is also observed in gnathostomes, but not protostome Hox clusters. We thus hypothesize that the much shorter vertebrate Hox clusters are the result of extensive resolution of the redundancy of regulatory DNA after the genome duplications rather than the consequence of a selection pressure to remove nonfunctional sequence from the Hox cluster.

VL  - 36
IS  - 8
AB  - Small non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have systematically been studied in various model organisms from Escherichia coli to Homo sapiens. Here, we analyse the small ncRNA transcriptome from the pathogenic filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. To that aim, we experimentally screened for ncRNAs, expressed under various growth conditions or during specific developmental stages, by generating a specialized cDNA library from size-selected small RNA species. Our screen revealed 30 novel ncRNA candidates from known ncRNA classes such as small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and C/D box-type small nucleolar RNAs (C/D box snoRNAs). Additionally, several candidates for H/ACA box snoRNAs could be predicted by a bioinformatical screen. We also identified 15 candidates for ncRNAs, which could not be assigned to any known ncRNA class. Some of these ncRNA species are developmentally regulated implying a possible novel function in A. fumigatus development. Surprisingly, in addition to full-length tRNAs, we also identified 5?- or 3?-halves of tRNAs, only, which are likely generated by tRNA cleavage within the anti-codon loop. We show that conidiation induces tRNA cleavage resulting in tRNA depletion within conidia. Since conidia represent the resting state of A. fumigatus we propose that conidial tRNA depletion might be a novel mechanism to down-regulate protein synthesis in a filamentous fungus.

AB  - In order to describe a cell at molecular level, a notion of a "gene" is neither necessary nor helpful. It is sufficient to consider the molecules (i.e., chromosomes, transcripts, proteins) and their interactions to describe cellular processes. The downside of the resulting high resolution is that it becomes very tedious to address features on the organismal and phenotypic levels with a language based on molecular terms. Looking for the missing link between biological disciplines dealing with different levels of biological organization, we suggest to return to the original intent behind the term "gene". To this end, we propose to investigate whether a useful notion of "gene" can be constructed based on an underlying notion of function, and whether this can serve as the necessary link and embed the various distinct gene concepts of biological (sub)disciplines in a coherent theoretical framework. In reply to the Genon Theory recently put forward by Klaus Scherrer and J√?rgen Jost in this journal, we shall discuss a general approach to assess a gene definition that should then be tested for its expressiveness and potential cross-disciplinary relevance.

JO  - Mol Biol Evol
SP  - 821
EP  - 30
VL  - 25
IS  - 5
AB  - Today, the reconstruction of the organismal evolutionary tree is based mainly on molecular sequence data. However, sequence data are sometimes insufficient to reliably resolve in particular deep branches. Thus, it is highly desirable to find novel, more reliable types of phylogenetic markers that can be derived from the wealth of genomic data. Here, we consider the gain of introns close to older preexisting ones. Because correct splicing is impeded by very small exons, nearby pairs of introns very rarely coexist, that is, the gain of the new intron is nearly always associated with the loss of the old intron. Both events may even be directly connected as in cases of intron migration. Therefore, it should be possible to identify one of the introns as ancient (plesiomorphic) and the other as novel (derived or apomorphic). To test the suitability of such near intron pairs (NIPs) as a marker class for phylogenetic analysis, we undertook an analysis of the evolutionary positions of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) in relation to moths (Lepidoptera) and dipterans (Diptera) using recently completed genome project data. By scanning 758 putatively orthologous gene structures of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera) and Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), we identified 189 pairs of introns, one from each species, which are located less than 50 nt from each other. A comparison with genes from 5 other holometabolan and 9 metazoan outgroup genomes resulted in 22 shared derived intron positions found in beetle as well as in butterflies and/or dipterans. This strongly supports a basal position of hymenopterans in the holometabolous insect tree. In addition, we found 31 and 12 intron positions apomorphic for A. mellifera and T. castaneum, respectively, which seem to represent changes inside these branches. Another 12 intron pairs indicate parallel intron gains or extraordinarily small exons. In conclusion, we show here that the analysis of phylogenetically nested, nearby intron pairs is suitable to identify evolutionarily younger intron positions and to determine their relative age, which should be of equal importance for the understanding of intron evolution and the reconstruction of the eukaryotic tree.

AB  - A comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial gene orders of all previously published and two novel Antedon mediterranea (Crinoidea) and Ophiura albida (Ophiuroidea) complete echinoderm mitochondrial genomes shows that all major types of rearrangement operations are necessary to explain the evolution of mitochondrial genomes. In addition to protein coding genes we include all tRNA genes as well as the control region in our analysis. Surprisingly, 7 of the 16 genomes published in the GenBank database contain misannotations, mostly unannotated tRNAs and/or mistakes in the orientation of tRNAs, which we have corrected here. Although the gene orders of mt genomes appear very different, only 8 events are necessary to explain the evolutionary history of echinoderms with the exception of the ophiuroids. Only two of these rearrangements are inversions, while we identify three tandem-duplication-random-loss events and three transpositions.

Based on the results of this search, we discuss the high variability of U7 snRNAs in both sequence and structure, and report on an attempt to find U7 snRNA sequences in basal deuterostomes and non-drosophilids insect genomes based on a combination of sequence, structure, and promoter features. Due to the extremely short sequence and the high variability in both sequence and structure, no unambiguous candidates were found. These results cast doubt on putative U7 homologs in even more distant organisms that are reported in the most recent release of the Rfam database.

EP  - 110
VL  - 123
IS  - 1
AB  - Higher teleost fishes, including zebrafish and fugu, have duplicated their Hox genes relative to the gene inventory of other gnathostome lineages. The most widely accepted theory contends that the duplicate Hox clusters orginated synchronously during a single genome duplication event in the early history of ray-finned fishes. In this contribution we collect and re-evaluate all publicly available sequence information. In particular, we show that the short Hox gene fragments from published PCR surveys of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus, the medaka Oryzias latipes and the goldfish Carassius auratus can be used to determine with little ambiguity not only their paralog group but also their membership in a particular cluster.Together with a survey of the genomic sequence data from the pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis we show that at least percomorpha, and possibly all eutelosts, share a system of 7 or 8 orthologous Hox gene clusters. There is little doubt about the orthology of the two teleost duplicates of the HoxA and HoxB clusters. A careful analysis of both the coding sequence of Hox genes and of conserved non-coding sequences provides additional support for the "duplication early" hypothesis that the Hox clusters in teleosts are derived from eight ancestral clusters by means of subsequent gene loss; the data remain ambiguous, however, in particular for the HoxC clusters.Assuming the "duplication early" hypothesis we use the new evidence on the Hox gene complements to determine the phylogenetic positions of gene-loss events in the wake of the cluster duplication. Surprisingly, we find that the resolution of redundancy seems to be a slow process that is still ongoing. A few suggestions on which additional sequence data would be most informative for resolving the history of the teleostean Hox genes are discussed.

AB  - A plethora of new functions of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been discovered in past few years. In fact, RNA is emerging as the central player in cellular regulation, taking on active roles in multiple regulatory layers from transcription, RNA maturation, and RNA modification to translational regulation. Nevertheless, very little is known about the evolution of this "Modern RNA World" and its components. In this contribution, we attempt to provide at least a cursory overview of the diversity of ncRNAs and functional RNA motifs in non-translated regions of regular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with an emphasis on evolutionary questions. This survey is complemented by an in-depth analysis of examples from different classes of RNAs focusing mostly on their evolution in the vertebrate lineage. We present a survey of Y RNA genes in vertebrates and study the molecular evolution of the U7 snRNA, the snoRNAs E1/U17, E2, and E3, the Y RNA family, the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family, and the mRNA-like evf-1 gene. We furthermore discuss the statistical distribution of miRNAs in metazoans, which suggests an explosive increase in the miRNA repertoire in vertebrates. The analysis of the transcription of ncRNAs suggests that small RNAs in general are genetically mobile in the sense that their association with a hostgene (e.g. when transcribed from introns of a mRNA) can change on evolutionary time scales. The let-7 family demonstrates, that even the mode of transcription (as intron or as exon) can change among paralogous ncRNA.

AB  - 7SK RNA is a highly abundant noncoding RNA in mammalian cells whose function in transcriptional regulation has only recently been elucidated. Despite its highly conserved sequence throughout vertebrates, all attempts to discover 7SK RNA homologues in invertebrate species have failed so far. Here we report on a combined experimental and computational survey that succeeded in discovering 7SK RNAs in most of the major deuterostome clades and in two protostome phyla: mollusks and annelids. Despite major efforts, no candidates were found in any of the many available ecdysozoan genomes, however. The additional sequence data confirm the evolutionary conservation and hence functional importance of the previously described 3? and 5? stem-loop motifs, and provide evidence for a third, structurally well-conserved domain.

AB  - Xenoturbella bocki has recently been identified as one of the most basal deuterostomes, although an even more basal phylogenetic position cannot be ruled out. Here we report on a polymerase chain reaction survey of partial Hox homeobox sequences of X. bocki. Surprisingly, we did not find evidence for more than five Hox genes, one clear labial/PG1 ortholog, one posterior gene most similar to the PG9/10 genes of Ambulacraria, and three central group genes whose precise assignment to a specific paralog group remains open. We furthermore report on a re-evaluation of the available published evidence of Hox genes in other basal deuterostomes.

AB  - The phylogenetic position of Xenoturbella bocki has been a matter of controversy since its description in 1949. We sequenced a second complete mitochondrial genome of this species and performed phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of all 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes and on its gene order. Our results confirm the deuterostome relationship of Xenoturbella. However, in contrast to a recently published study (Bourlat et al. in Nature 444:85-88, 2006), our data analysis suggests a more basal branching of Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes, rather than a sister-group relationship to the Ambulacraria (Hemichordata and Echinodermata).

JO  - J Biol Chem
SP  - 2049
EP  - 59
VL  - 283
IS  - 4
AB  - Telomerase extends chromosome ends by copying a short template sequence within its intrinsic RNA component. Telomerase RNA (TR) from different groups of species varies dramatically in sequence and size. We report here the bioinformatic identification, secondary structure comparison, and functional analysis of the smallest known vertebrate TRs from five teleost fishes. The teleost TRs (312-348 nucleotides) are significantly smaller than the cartilaginous fish TRs (478-559 nucleotides) and tetrapod TRs. This remarkable length reduction of teleost fish TRs correlates positively with the genome size, reflecting an unusual structural plasticity of TR during evolution. The teleost TR consists of a compact three-domain structure, lacking most of the sequences in regions that are variable in other vertebrate TR structures. The medaka and fugu TRs, when assembled with their telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein counterparts, reconstituted active and processive telomerase enzymes. Titration analysis of individual RNA domains suggests that the efficient assembly of the telomerase complex is influenced more by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) binding of the CR4-CR5 domain than the pseudoknot domain of TR. The remarkably small teleost fish TR further expands our understanding about the evolutionary divergence of vertebrate TR.

TI  - Computational RNomics of drosophilids.
JO  - BMC Genomics
SP  - 406
VL  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent experimental and computational studies have provided overwhelming evidence for a plethora of diverse transcripts that are unrelated to protein-coding genes. One subclass consists of those RNAs that require distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns of sequence conservation characteristic for positive selection on RNA secondary structure.The deep-sequencing of 12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides an ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to determine those genomic loci that code for evolutionarily conserved RNA motifs. This class of loci includes the majority of the known small ncRNAs as well as structured RNA motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey using RNAz. RESULTS: We obtain 16 000 high quality predictions among which we recover the majority of the known ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the hallmarks of stabilizing selection action of RNA structure, and hence are most likely functional at the RNA level. A subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J. 26: 79-89 (2007)], which are plausible candidates of Pol III transcripts, have been studied in more detail. Among these sequences we identify several "clusters" of ncRNA candidates with striking structural similarities. CONCLUSION: The statistical evaluation of the RNAz predictions in comparison with a similar analysis of vertebrate genomes [Washietl et al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383-1390 (2005)] shows that qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found in introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. The intergenic RNA structures, however, are concentrated much more closely around known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have significantly smaller complement of independent structured ncRNAs compared to mammals.

TI  - SnoReport: computational identification of snoRNAs with unknown targets.
JO  - Bioinformatics
SP  - 158
EP  - 64
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
AB  - Unlike tRNAs and microRNAs, both classes of snoRNAs, which direct two distinct types of chemical modifications of uracil residues, have proved to be surprisingly difficult to find in genomic sequences. Most computational approaches so far have explicitly used the fact that snoRNAs predominantly target ribosomal RNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. The target is specified by a short stretch of sequence complementarity between the snoRNA and its target. This sequence complementarity to known targets crucially contributes to sensitivity and specificity of snoRNA gene finding algorithms. The discovery of ?orphan? snoRNAs, which either have no known target, or which target ordinary protein-coding mRNAs, however, begs the question whether this class of ?housekeeping? non-coding RNAs is much more widespread and might have a diverse set of regulatory functions. In order to approach this question, we present here a combination of RNA secondary structure prediction and machine learning that is designed to recognize the two major classes of snoRNAs, box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, among ncRNA candidate sequences. The snoReport approach deliberately avoids any usage of target information. We find that the combination of the conserved sequence boxes and secondary structure constraints as a pre-filter with SVM classifiers based on a small set of structural descriptors are sufficient for a reliable identification of snoRNAs. Tests of snoReport on data from several recent experimental surveys show that the approach is feasible; the application to a dataset from a large-scale comparative genomics survey for ncRNAs suggests that there are likely hundreds of previously undescribed ?orphan? snoRNAs still hidden in the human genome.

SP  - 437

VL  - 61
IS  - 3
AB  - The secondary structures of nucleic acids form a particularly important class of contact structures. Many important RNA molecules, however, contain pseudo-knots, a structural feature that is excluded explicitly from the conventional definition of secondary structures. We propose here a generalization of secondary structures incorporating ?non-nested? pseudo-knots, which we call bi-secondary structures, and discuss measures for the complexity of more general contact structures based on their graph-theoretical properties. Bi-secondary structures are planar trivalent graphs that are characterized by special embedding properties. We derive exact upper bounds on their number (as a function of the chain length n) implying that there are fewer different structures than sequences. Computational results show that the number of bi-secondary structures grows approximately like 2.35n. Numerical studies based on kinetic folding and a simple extension of the standard energy model show that the global features of the sequence-structure map of RNA do not change when pseudo-knots are introduced into the secondary structure picture. We find a large fraction of neutral mutations and, in particular, networks of sequences that fold into the same shape. These neutral networks percolate through the entire sequence space.

VL  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in a wide spectrum of regulatory functions. Within recent years, there have been increasing reports of observed polyadenylated ncRNAs and mRNA like ncRNAs in eukaryotes. To investigate this further, we examined the large data set in the Sino-Danish PigEST resource http://pigest.ku.dk which also contains expression information distributed on 97 non-normalized cDNA libraries. RESULTS: We constructed a pipeline, EST2ncRNA, to search for known and novel ncRNAs. The pipeline utilises sequence similarity to ncRNA databases (blast), structure similarity to Rfam (RaveNnA) as well as multiple alignments to predict conserved novel putative RNA structures (RNAz). EST2ncRNA was fed with 48,000 contigs and 73,000 singletons available from the PigEST resource. Using the pipeline we identified known RNA structures in 137 contigs and single reads (conreads), and predicted high confidence RNA structures in non-protein coding regions of additional 1,262 conreads. Of these, structures in 270 conreads overlap with existing predictions in human. To sum up, the PigEST resource comprises trans-acting elements (ncRNAs) in 715 contigs and 340 singletons as well as cis-acting elements (inside UTRs) in 311 contigs and 51 singletons, of which 18 conreads contain both predictions of trans- and cis-acting elements. The predicted RNAz candidates were compared with the PigEST expression information and we identify 114 contigs with an RNAz prediction and expression in at least ten of the non-normalised cDNA libraries. We conclude that the contigs with RNAz and known predictions are in general expressed at a much lower level than protein coding transcripts. In addition, we also observe that our ncRNA candidates constitute about one to two percent of the genes expressed in the cDNA libraries. Intriguingly, the cDNA libraries from developmental (brain) tissues contain the highest amount of ncRNA candidates, about two percent. These observations are related to existing knowledge and hypotheses about the role of ncRNAs in higher organisms. Furthermore, about 80% porcine coding transcripts (of 18,600 identified) as well as less than one-third ORF-free transcripts are conserved at least in the closely related bovine genome. Approximately one percent of the coding and 10% of the remaining matches are unique between the PigEST data and cow genome. Based on the pig-cow alignments, we searched for similarities to 16 other organisms by UCSC available alignments, which resulted in a 87% coverage by the human genome for instance. CONCLUSION: Besides recovering several of the already annotated functional RNA structures, we predicted a large number of high confidence conserved secondary structures in polyadenylated porcine transcripts. Our observations of relatively low expression levels of predicted ncRNA candidates together with the observations of higher relative amount in cDNA libraries from developmental stages are in agreement with the current paradigm of ncRNA roles in higher organisms and supports the idea of polyadenylated ncRNAs.

TI  - Progressive multiple sequence alignments from triplets.
JO  - BMC Bioinformatics
SP  - 254
VL  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The quality of progressive sequence alignments strongly depends on the accuracy of the individual pairwise alignment steps since gaps that are introduced at one step cannot be removed at later aggregation steps. Adjacent insertions and deletions necessarily appear in arbitrary order in pairwise alignments and hence form an unavoidable source of errors. RESEARCH: Here we present a modified variant of progressive sequence alignments that addresses both issues. Instead of pairwise alignments we use exact dynamic programming to align sequence or profile triples. This avoids a large fractions of the ambiguities arising in pairwise alignments. In the subsequent aggregation steps we follow the logic of the Neighbor-Net algorithm, which constructs a phylogenetic network by step-wisely replacing triples by pairs instead of combining pairs to singletons. To this end the three-way alignments are subdivided into two partial alignments, at which stage all-gap columns are naturally removed. This alleviates the "once a gap, always a gap" problem of progressive alignment procedures. CONCLUSION: The three-way Neighbor-Net based alignment program aln3nn is shown to compare favorably on both protein sequences and nucleic acids sequences to other progressive alignment tools. In the latter case one easily can include scoring terms that consider secondary structure features. Overall, the quality of resulting alignments in general exceeds that of clustalw or other multiple alignments tools even though our software does not included heuristics for context dependent (mis)match scores.

AB  - Dynamic programming algorithms solve many standard problems of RNA bioinformatics in polynomial time. In this contribution we discuss a series of variations on these standard methods that implement refined biophysical models, such as a restriction of RNA folding to canonical structures, and an extension of structural alignments to an explicit scoring of stacking propensities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a local structural alignment can be employed for ncRNA gene finding. In this context we discuss scanning variants for folding and alignment algorithms.

JO  - BMC Biol
SP  - 25
VL  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an emerging focus for both computational analysis and experimental research, resulting in a growing number of novel, non-protein coding transcripts with often unknown functions. Whole genome screens in higher eukaryotes, for example, provided evidence for a surprisingly large number of ncRNAs. To supplement these searches, we performed a computational analysis of seven yeast species and searched for new ncRNAs and RNA motifs. RESULTS: A comparative analysis of the genomes of seven yeast species yielded roughly 2800 genomic loci that showed the hallmarks of evolutionary conserved RNA secondary structures. A total of 74% of these regions overlapped with annotated non-coding or coding genes in yeast. Coding sequences that carry predicted structured RNA elements belong to a limited number of groups with common functions, suggesting that these RNA elements are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and/or cellular localization. About 700 conserved RNA structures were found outside annotated coding sequences and known ncRNA genes. Many of these predicted elements overlapped with UTR regions of particular classes of protein coding genes. In addition, a number of RNA elements overlapped with previously characterized antisense transcripts. Transcription of about 120 predicted elements located in promoter regions and other, previously un-annotated, intergenic regions was supported by tiling array experiments, ESTs, or SAGE data. CONCLUSION: Our computational predictions strongly suggest that yeasts harbor a substantial pool of several hundred novel ncRNAs. In addition, we describe a large number of RNA structures in coding sequences and also within antisense transcripts that were previously characterized using tiling arrays.

AB  - We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.

VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - Functional RNA structures play an important role both in the context of noncoding RNA transcripts as well as regulatory elements in mRNAs. Here we present a computational study to detect functional RNA structures within the ENCODE regions of the human genome. Since structural RNAs in general lack characteristic signals in primary sequence, comparative approaches evaluating evolutionary conservation of structures are most promising. We have used three recently introduced programs based on either phylogenetic-stochastic context-free grammar (EvoFold) or energy directed folding (RNAz and AlifoldZ), yielding several thousand candidate structures (corresponding to approximately 2.7% of the ENCODE regions). EvoFold has its highest sensitivity in highly conserved and relatively AU-rich regions, while RNAz favors slightly GC-rich regions, resulting in a relatively small overlap between methods. Comparison with the GENCODE annotation points to functional RNAs in all genomic contexts, with a slightly increased density in 3?-UTRs. While we estimate a significant false discovery rate of approximately 50%-70% many of the predictions can be further substantiated by additional criteria: 248 loci are predicted by both RNAz and EvoFold, and an additional 239 RNAz or EvoFold predictions are supported by the (more stringent) AlifoldZ algorithm. Five hundred seventy RNAz structure predictions fall into regions that show signs of selection pressure also on the sequence level (i.e., conserved elements). More than 700 predictions overlap with noncoding transcripts detected by oligonucleotide tiling arrays. One hundred seventy-five selected candidates were tested by RT-PCR in six tissues, and expression could be verified in 43 cases (24.6%).

AB  - MOTIVATION: Genome-wide screens for structured ncRNA genes in mammals, urochordates, and nematodes have predicted thousands of putative ncRNA genes and other structured RNA motifs. A prerequisite for their functional annotation is to determine the reading direction with high precision. RESULTS: While folding energies of an RNA and its reverse complement are similar, the differences are sufficient at least in conjunction with substitution patterns to discriminate between structured RNAs and their complements. We present here a support vector machine that reliably classifies the reading direction of a structured RNA from a multiple sequence alignment and provides a considerable improvement in classification accuracy over previous approaches. SOFTWARE: RNAstrand is freely available as a stand-alone tool from http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/RNAstrand and is also included in the latest release of RNAz, a part of the Vienna RNA Package.

AB  - Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.

AB  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is implicated in the pathogenesis of many malignancies and essential for IL-6-dependent survival and growth of multiple myeloma cells. Here, we demonstrate that the gene encoding oncogenic microRNA-21 (miR-21) is controlled by an upstream enhancer containing 2 Stat3 binding sites strictly conserved since the first observed evolutionary appearance of miR-21 and Stat3. MiR-21 induction by IL-6 was strictly Stat3 dependent. Ectopically raising miR-21 expression in myeloma cells in the absence of IL-6 significantly reduced their apoptosis levels. These data provide strong evidence that miR-21 induction contributes to the oncogenic potential of Stat3.

JO  - J Theor Biol
SP  - 544
EP  - 53
VL  - 247
IS  - 3
AB  - Both experimental as well as sequence evolution evidence suggests that transcription factor binding sites can undergo divergence and turnover even when the transcriptional output remains conserved. Furthermore, it is likely that there exist lineage specific differences in the retention rate of binding sites that make it desirable to estimate the rate of acquisition and decay of transcription factor binding sites from comparative sequence data. In this paper we propose a stochastic, phenomenological model for binding site turnover. For a given genomic region we assume a constant rate of binding site origination lambda and a constant per site decay rate of mu. We derived an explicit expression for the conditional probability distribution of the number of binding sites n at time t given n(0) binding sites at t=0. The analytical result was compared to a simulation model and we found that it closely predicts the simulated sequence evolution. We then analyzed a small data set of the number of estrogen response elements (ERE) in mammalian HoxA sequences and showed that the data is broadly consistent with the assumption of a stationary turnover process. A regression of shared EREs over the time since divergence led to an estimate of the half-life time for an ERE in the primate HoxA clusters of about 27 Myr, which corresponds to a per site decay rate of mu approximately 1.3 x 10(-8)/year and a rate of origination of lambda approximately 1.6 x 10(-7)/year. We conclude that the model can be used to estimate the rate of binding site turnover from comparative genomic data.

TI  - Inferring noncoding RNA families and classes by means of genome-scale structure-based clustering.
JO  - PLoS Comput Biol
SP  - 65
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.

TI  - RNase MRP and the RNA processing cascade in the eukaryotic ancestor.
JO  - BMC Evol Biol
SP  - 13
VL  - 7 Suppl 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within eukaryotes there is a complex cascade of RNA-based macromolecules that process other RNA molecules, especially mRNA, tRNA and rRNA. An example is RNase MRP processing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in ribosome biogenesis. One hypothesis is that this complexity was present early in eukaryotic evolution; an alternative is that an initial simpler network later gained complexity by gene duplication in lineages that led to animals, fungi and plants. Recently there has been a rapid increase in support for the complexity-early theory because the vast majority of these RNA-processing reactions are found throughout eukaryotes, and thus were likely to be present in the last common ancestor of living eukaryotes, herein called the Eukaryotic Ancestor. RESULTS: We present an overview of the RNA processing cascade in the Eukaryotic Ancestor and investigate in particular, RNase MRP which was previously thought to have evolved later in eukaryotes due to its apparent limited distribution in fungi and animals and plants. Recent publications, as well as our own genomic searches, find previously unknown RNase MRP RNAs, indicating that RNase MRP has a wide distribution in eukaryotes. Combining secondary structure and promoter region analysis of RNAs for RNase MRP, along with analysis of the target substrate (rRNA), allows us to discuss this distribution in the light of eukaryotic evolution. CONCLUSION: We conclude that RNase MRP can now be placed in the RNA-processing cascade of the Eukaryotic Ancestor, highlighting the complexity of RNA-processing in early eukaryotes. Promoter analyses of MRP-RNA suggest that regulation of the critical processes of rRNA cleavage can vary, showing that even these key cellular processes (for which we expect high conservation) show some species-specific variability. We present our consensus MRP-RNA secondary structure as a useful model for further searches.

AB  - A tetraploidization event took place in the cyprinid lineage leading to goldfishes about 15 million years ago. A PCR survey for Hox genes in the goldfish Carassius auratus auratus (Actinopterygii: Cyprinidae) was performed to assess the consequences of this genome duplication. Not surprisingly, the genomic organization of the Hox gene clusters of goldfish is similar to that of the closely related zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, the goldfish exhibits a much larger number of recent pseudogenes, which are characterized by indels. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dosage effects cause selection pressure to rapidly silence crucial developmental regulators after a tetraploidization event.

In this contribution we review the state of the art of "computational RNomics", i.e., the bioinformatics approaches to genome-wide RNA annotation. Instead of rehashing results from recently published surveys in detail, we focus here on the open problem in the field, namely (functional) annotation of the plethora of putative RNAs. A series of exploratory studies are used to provide non-trivial examples for the discussion of some of the difficulties.

AB  - Dynamical models that explain the formation of spatial structures of RNA molecules have reached a complexity that requires novel visualization methods that help to analyze the validity of these models. Here, we focus on the visualization of so-called folding landscapes of a growing RNA molecule. Folding landscapes describe the energy of a molecule as a function of its spatial configuration; thus they are huge and high dimensional. Their most salient features, however, are encapsulated by their so-called barrier tree that reflects the local minima and their connecting saddle points. For each length of the growing RNA chain there exists a folding landscape. We visualize the sequence of folding landscapes by an animation of the corresponding barrier trees. To generate the animation, we adapt the foresight layout with tolerance algorithm for general dynamic graph layout problems. Since it is very general, we give a detailed description of each phase: constructing a supergraph for the trees, layout of that supergraph using a modified DoT algorithm, and presentation techniques for the final animation.

Here, we present a method for computing the consensus structures including pseudoknots based on alignments of a few sequences. The algorithm combines thermodynamic and covariation information to assign scores to all possible base pairs, the base pairs are chosen with the help of the maximum weighted matching algorithm. We applied our algorithm to a number of different types of RNA known to contain pseudoknots. All pseudoknots were predicted correctly and more than 85 percent of the base pairs were identified.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form a large class of small regulatory RNAs in eukaryotes. Although they share a common processing pathway and certain structural features, in general, there is no detectable sequence similarity among miRNAs from a given organism. On the other hand, many miRNAs are members of a family of a few, often very similar, paralogs. It is, thus, of interest to trace the evolutionary history of individual miRNAs, to identify the timing of gene duplications, and to study relationships between the histories of different miRNA families. Some miRNAs are transcribed from polycistronic primary transcripts. In these cases, we will study the evolution of entire clusters.

JO  - Mol Phylogenet Evol
SP  - 298
EP  - 307
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
AB  - We study to what degree patterns of amino acid substitution vary between genes using two models of protein-coding gene evolution. The first divides the amino acids into groups, with one substitution rate for pairs of residues in the same group and a second for those in differing groups. Unlike previous applications of this model, the groups themselves are estimated from data by simulated annealing. The second model makes substitution rates a function of the physical and chemical similarity between two residues. Because we model the evolution of coding DNA sequences as opposed to protein sequences, artifacts arising from the differing numbers of nucleotide substitutions required to bring about various amino acid substitutions are avoided. Using 10 alignments of related sequences (five of orthologous genes and five gene families), we do find differences in substitution patterns. We also find that, although patterns of amino acid substitution vary temporally within the history of a gene, variation is not greater in paralogous than in orthologous genes. Improved understanding of such gene-specific variation in substitution patterns may have implications for applications such as sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference.

JO  - Algorithms Mol Biol

AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA has been recognized as a key player in cellular regulation in recent years. In many cases, non-coding RNAs exert their function by binding to other nucleic acids, as in the case of microRNAs and snoRNAs. The specificity of these interactions derives from the stability of inter-molecular base pairing. The accurate computational treatment of RNA-RNA binding therefore lies at the heart of target prediction algorithms. METHODS: The standard dynamic programming algorithms for computing secondary structures of linear single-stranded RNA molecules are extended to the co-folding of two interacting RNAs. RESULTS: We present a program, RNAcofold, that computes the hybridization energy and base pairing pattern of a pair of interacting RNA molecules. In contrast to earlier approaches, complex internal structures in both RNAs are fully taken into account. RNAcofold supports the calculation of the minimum energy structure and of a complete set of suboptimal structures in an energy band above the ground state. Furthermore, it provides an extension of McCaskill?s partition function algorithm to compute base pairing probabilities, realistic interaction energies, and equilibrium concentrations of duplex structures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated software tools for multiple alignment often fail to produce biologically meaningful results. In such situations, expert knowledge can help to improve the quality of alignments. RESULTS: Herein, we describe a semi-automatic version of the alignment program DIALIGN that can take pre-defined constraints into account. It is possible for the user to specify parts of the sequences that are assumed to be homologous and should therefore be aligned to each other. Our software program can use these sites as anchor points by creating a multiple alignment respecting these constraints. This way, our alignment method can produce alignments that are biologically more meaningful than alignments produced by fully automated procedures. As a demonstration of how our method works, we apply our approach to genomic sequences around the Hox gene cluster and to a set of DNA-binding proteins. As a by-product, we obtain insights about the performance of the greedy algorithm that our program uses for multiple alignment and about the underlying objective function. This information will be useful for the further development of DIALIGN. The described alignment approach has been integrated into the TRACKER software system.

AB  - The ParaHox cluster contains three Hox-related homeobox genes. The evolution of this sister of the Hox-gene clusters has been studied extensively in metazoans with a focus on its early evolution. Its fate within the vertebrate lineage, and in particular following the teleost-specific genome duplication, however, has not received much attention. Three of the four human ParaHox loci are linked with PDGFR family tyrosine kinases. We demonstrate that these loci arose as duplications in an ancestral vertebrate and trace the subsequent history of gene losses. Surprisingly, teleost fishes have not expanded their ParaHox repertoire following the teleost-specific genome duplication, while duplicates of the associated tyrosine kinases have survived, supporting the hypothesis of a large-scale duplication followed by extensive gene loss.

AB  - The occurrence of self-avoiding closed paths (cycles) in networks is studied under varying rules of wiring. As a main result, we find that the dependence between network size and typical cycle length is algebraic, (h) proportional to Nalpha, with distinct values of for different wiring rules. The Barabasi-Albert model has alpha=1. Different preferential and nonpreferential attachment rules and the growing Internet graph yield alpha$<$1. Computation of the statistics of cycles at arbitrary length is made possible by the introduction of an efficient sampling algorithm.

TI  - The expansion of the metazoan microRNA repertoire.
JO  - BMC Genomics
SP  - 25
VL  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs have been identified as crucial regulators in both animals and plants. Here we report on a comprehensive comparative study of all known miRNA families in animals. We expand the MicroRNA Registry 6.0 by more than 1000 new homologs of miRNA precursors whose expression has been verified in at least one species. Using this uniform data basis we analyze their evolutionary history in terms of individual gene phylogenies and in terms of preservation of genomic nearness across species. This allows us to reliably identify microRNA clusters that are derived from a common transcript. RESULTS: We identify three episodes of microRNA innovation that correspond to major developmental innovations: A class of about 20 miRNAs is common to protostomes and deuterostomes and might be related to the advent of bilaterians. A second large wave of innovations maps to the branch leading to the vertebrates. The third significant outburst of miRNA innovation coincides with placental (eutherian) mammals. In addition, we observe the expected expansion of the microRNA inventory due to genome duplications in early vertebrates and in an ancestral teleost. The non-local duplications in the vertebrate ancestor are predated by local (tandem) duplications leading to the formation of about a dozen ancient microRNA clusters. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that microRNA innovation is an ongoing process. Major expansions of the metazoan miRNA repertoire coincide with the advent of bilaterians, vertebrates, and (placental) mammals.

JO  - BMC Bioinformatics
SP  - 67
VL  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparison of metabolic networks is typically performed based on the organisms? enzyme contents. This approach disregards functional replacements as well as orthologies that are misannotated. Direct comparison of the structure of metabolic networks can circumvent these problems. RESULTS: Metabolic networks are naturally represented as directed hypergraphs in such a way that metabolites are nodes and enzyme-catalyzed reactions form (hyper)edges. The familiar operations from set algebra (union, intersection, and difference) form a natural basis for both the pairwise comparison of networks and identification of distinct metabolic features of a set of algorithms. We report here on an implementation of this approach and its application to the procaryotes. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that metabolic networks contain valuable phylogenetic information by comparing phylogenies obtained from network comparisons with 16S RNA phylogenies. The algebraic approach to metabolic networks is suitable to study metabolic innovations in two sets of organisms, free living microbes and Pyrococci, as well as obligate intracellular pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A small class of RNA molecules, in particular the tiny genomes of viroids, are circular. Yet most structure prediction algorithms handle only linear RNAs. The most straightforward approach is to compute circular structures from ?internal? and ?external? substructures separated by a base pair. This is incompatible, however, with the memory-saving approach of the Vienna RNA Package which builds a linear RNA structure from shorter (internal) structures only. RESULT: Here we describe how circular secondary structures can be obtained without additional memory requirements as a kind of ?post-processing? of the linear structures. AVAILABILITY: The circular folding algorithm is implemented in the current version of the of RNAfold program of the Vienna RNA Package, which can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable prediction of RNA-RNA binding energies is crucial, e.g. for the understanding on RNAi, microRNA-mRNA binding and antisense interactions. The thermodynamics of such RNA-RNA interactions can be understood as the sum of two energy contributions: (1) the energy necessary to ?open? the binding site and (2) the energy gained from hybridization. METHODS: We present an extension of the standard partition function approach to RNA secondary structures that computes the probabilities Pu[i, j] that a sequence interval [i, j] is unpaired. RESULTS: Comparison with experimental data shows that Pu[i, j] can be applied as a significant determinant of local target site accessibility for RNA interference (RNAi). Furthermore, these quantities can be used to rigorously determine binding free energies of short oligomers to large mRNA targets. The resource consumption is comparable with a single partition function computation for the large target molecule. We can show that RNAi efficiency correlates well with the binding energies of siRNAs to their respective mRNA target.

AB  - We present a survey for non-coding RNAs and other structured RNA motifs in the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae using the RNAz program. This approach explicitly evaluates comparative sequence information to detect stabilizing selection acting on RNA secondary structure. We detect 3,672 structured RNA motifs, of which only 678 are known non-translated RNAs (ncRNAs) or clear homologs of known C. elegans ncRNAs. Most of these signals are located in introns or at a distance from known protein-coding genes. With an estimated false positive rate of about 50% and a sensitivity on the order of 50%, we estimate that the nematode genomes contain between 3,000 and 4,000 RNAs with evolutionary conserved secondary structures. Only a small fraction of these belongs to the known RNA classes, including tRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, or microRNAs. A relatively small class of ncRNA candidates is associated with previously observed RNA-specific upstream elements.

AB  - Recent work has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in critical biological processes by suppressing the translation of coding genes. This work develops an integrated database, miRNAMap, to store the known miRNA genes, the putative miRNA genes, the known miRNA targets and the putative miRNA targets. The known miRNA genes in four mammalian genomes such as human, mouse, rat and dog are obtained from miRBase, and experimentally validated miRNA targets are identified in a survey of the literature. Putative miRNA precursors were identified by RNAz, which is a non-coding RNA prediction tool based on comparative sequence analysis. The mature miRNA of the putative miRNA genes is accurately determined using a machine learning approach, mmiRNA. Then, miRanda was applied to predict the miRNA targets within the conserved regions in 3?-UTR of the genes in the four mammalian genomes. The miRNAMap also provides the expression profiles of the known miRNAs, cross-species comparisons, gene annotations and cross-links to other biological databases. Both textual and graphical web interface are provided to facilitate the retrieval of data from the miRNAMap. The database is freely available at http://mirnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.

AB  - Mitochondrial genomes provide a valuable dataset for phylogenetic studies, in particular of metazoan phylogeny because of the extensive taxon sample that is available. Beyond the traditional sequence-based analysis it is possible to extract phylogenetic information from the gene order. Here we present a novel approach utilizing these data based on cyclic list alignments of the gene orders. A progressive alignment approach is used to combine pairwise list alignments into a multiple alignment of gene orders. Parsimony methods are used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, ancestral gene orders, and consensus patterns in a straightforward approach. We apply this method to study the phylogeny of protostomes based exclusively on mitochondrial genome arrangements. We, furthermore, demonstrate that our approach is also applicable to the much larger genomes of chloroplasts.

AB  - In contrast to the fairly reliable and complete annotation of the protein coding genes in the human genome, comparable information is lacking for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). We present a comparative screen of vertebrate genomes for structural noncoding RNAs, which evaluates conserved genomic DNA sequences for signatures of structural conservation of base-pairing patterns and exceptional thermodynamic stability. We predict more than 30,000 structured RNA elements in the human genome, almost 1,000 of which are conserved across all vertebrates. Roughly a third are found in introns of known genes, a sixth are potential regulatory elements in untranslated regions of protein-coding mRNAs and about half are located far away from any known gene. Only a small fraction of these sequences has been described previously. A comparison with recent tiling array data shows that more than 40% of the predicted structured RNAs overlap with experimentally detected sites of transcription. The widespread conservation of secondary structure points to a large number of functional ncRNAs and cis-acting mRNA structures in the human genome.

AB  - MOTIVATION: The analysis of animal genomes showed that only a minute part of their DNA codes for proteins. Recent experimental results agree, however, that a large fraction of these genomes are transcribed and hence are probably functional at the RNA level. A computational survey of vertebrate genomes has predicted thousands of previously unknown ncRNAs with evolutionarily conserved secondary structures. Extending these comparative studies beyond vertebrates is difficult, however, since most ncRNAs evolve quickly at the sequence level while conserving their characteristic secondarystructures. RESULTS: We report on a computational screen of structured ncRNAs in the urochordate lineage based on a comparison of the genomic data from Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica. We predict $>$1000 ncRNAs with an evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structure. Of these, about a quarter are located in introns of known protein coding sequences. A few RNA motifs can be identified as known RNAs, including approximately 300 tRNAs, some 100 snRNA genes and a few microRNAs and snoRNAs.

SP  - 121
EP  - 36
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
AB  - The Hox gene complement of zebrafish, medaka, and fugu differs from that of other gnathostome vertebrates. These fishes have seven to eight Hox clusters compared to the four Hox clusters described in sarcopterygians and shark. The clusters in different teleost lineages are orthologous, implying that a "fish-specific" Hox cluster duplication has occurred in the stem lineage leading to the most recent common ancestor of zebrafish and fugu. The timing of this event, however, is unknown. To address this question, we sequenced four Hox genes from taxa representing basal actinopterygian and teleost lineages and compared them to known sequences from shark, coelacanth, zebrafish, and other teleosts. The resulting gene genealogies suggest that the fish-specific Hox cluster duplication occurred coincident with the origin of crown group teleosts. In addition, we obtained evidence for an independent Hox cluster duplication in the sturgeon lineage (Acipenseriformes). Finally, results from HoxA11 suggest that duplicated Hox genes have experienced diversifying selection immediately after the duplication event. Taken together, these results support the notion that the duplicated Hox genes of teleosts were causally relevant to adaptive evolution during the initial teleost radiation.

VL  - 11

AB  - Retroelement RNAs serve as templates for both translation and reverse transcription into extrachromosomal DNA. DNA copies may be inserted into the host genome to multiply element sequences. This transpositional activity of retroelements is usually restricted to specific conditions, particularly to conditions that impose stress on the host organism. In this work, we examined how the mRNA initiation point, and features of primary and secondary structure, of tobacco retrotransposon Tto1 RNA influence its transpositional activity. We found that the most abundant Tto1 RNA is not a substrate for reverse transcription. It is poorly translated, and its 5?-end does not contain a region of redundancy with the most prominent 3?-end. In contrast, expression of an mRNA with the 5?-end extended by 28 nucleotides allows translation and gives rise to transposition events in the heterologous host, Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, the presence of extended hairpins and of two short open reading frames in the 5?-leader sequence of Tto1 mRNA suggests that translation does not involve ribosome scanning from the mRNA 5?-end to the translation initiation site.

JO  - BMC Bioinformatics
SP  - 160
VL  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: High quality sequence alignments of RNA and DNA sequences are an important prerequisite for the comparative analysis of genomic sequence data. Nucleic acid sequences, however, exhibit a much larger sequence heterogeneity compared to their encoded protein sequences due to the redundancy of the genetic code. It is desirable, therefore, to make use of the amino acid sequence when aligning coding nucleic acid sequences. In many cases, however, only a part of the sequence of interest is translated. On the other hand, overlapping reading frames may encode multiple alternative proteins, possibly with intermittent non-coding parts. Examples are, in particular, RNA virus genomes. RESULTS: The standard scoring scheme for nucleic acid alignments can be extended to incorporate simultaneously information on translation products in one or more reading frames. Here we present a multiple alignment tool, codaln, that implements a combined nucleic acid plus amino acid scoring model for pairwise and progressive multiple alignments that allows arbitrary weighting for almost all scoring parameters. Resource requirements of codaln are comparable with those of standard tools such as ClustalW. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the applicability of codaln to various biologically relevant types of sequences (bacteriophage Levivirus and Vertebrate Hox clusters) and show that the combination of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information leads to improved alignments. These, in turn, increase the performance of analysis tools that depend strictly on good input alignments such as methods for detecting conserved RNA secondary structure elements.

JO  - J Mol Evol
SP  - 665
EP  - 76
VL  - 60
IS  - 5
AB  - In this study the molecular evolution of duplicated HoxA genes in zebrafish and fugu has been investigated. All 18 duplicated HoxA genes studied have a higher non-synonymous substitution rate than the corresponding genes in either bichir or paddlefish, where these genes are not duplicated. The higher rate of evolution is not due solely to a higher non-synonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio but to an increase in both the non-synonymous as well as the synonymous substitution rate. The synonymous rate increase can be explained by a change in base composition, codon usage, or mutation rate. We found no changes in nucleotide composition or codon bias. Thus, we suggest that the HoxA genes may experience an increased mutation rate following cluster duplication. In the non-Hox nuclear gene RAG1 only an increase in non-synonymous substitutions could be detected, suggesting that the increased mutation rate is specific to duplicated Hox clusters and might be related to the structural instability of Hox clusters following duplication. The divergence among paralog genes tends to be asymmetric, with one paralog diverging faster than the other. In fugu, all b-paralogs diverge faster than the a-paralogs, while in zebrafish Hoxa-13a diverges faster. This asymmetry corresponds to the asymmetry in the divergence rate of conserved non-coding sequences, i.e., putative cis-regulatory elements. These results suggest that the 5? HoxA genes in the same cluster belong to a co-evolutionary unit in which genes have a tendency to diverge together.

JO  - BMC Genomics

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Promoters are key players in gene regulation. They receive signals from various sources (e.g. cell surface receptors) and control the level of transcription initiation, which largely determines gene expression. In vertebrates, transcription start sites and surrounding regulatory elements are often poorly defined. To support promoter analysis, we present CORG http://corg.molgen.mpg.de, a framework for studying upstream regions including untranslated exons (5? UTR). DESCRIPTION: The automated annotation of promoter regions integrates information of two kinds. First, statistically significant cross-species conservation within upstream regions of orthologous genes is detected. Pairwise as well as multiple sequence comparisons are computed. Second, binding site descriptions (position-weight matrices) are employed to predict conserved regulatory elements with a novel approach. Assembled EST sequences and verified transcription start sites are incorporated to distinguish exonic from other sequences.As of now, we have included 5 species in our analysis pipeline (man, mouse, rat, fugu and zebrafish). We characterized promoter regions of 16,127 groups of orthologous genes. All data are presented in an intuitive way via our web site. Users are free to export data for single genes or access larger data sets via our DAS server http://tomcat.molgen.mpg.de:8080/das. The benefits of our framework are exemplarily shown in the context of phylogenetic profiling of transcription factor binding sites and detection of microRNAs close to transcription start sites of our gene set. CONCLUSION: The CORG platform is a versatile tool to support analyses of gene regulation in vertebrate promoter regions. Applications for CORG cover a broad range from studying evolution of DNA binding sites and promoter constitution to the discovery of new regulatory sequence elements (e.g. microRNAs and binding sites).

JO  - Gene
SP  - 3

VL  - 345
IS  - 1
AB  - RNA-ligand binding often depends crucially on the local RNA secondary structure at the binding site. We develop here a model that quantitatively predicts the effect of RNA secondary structure on effective RNA-ligand binding activities based on equilibrium thermodynamics and the explicit computations of partition functions for the RNA structures. A statistical test for the impact of a particular structural feature on the binding affinities follows directly from this approach. The formalism is extended to describing the effects of hybridizing small "modifier RNAs" to a target RNA molecule outside its ligand binding site. We illustrate the applicability of our approach by quantitatively describing the interaction of the mRNA stabilizing protein HuR with AU-rich elements. We discuss our model and recent experimental findings demonstrating the effectivity of modifier RNAs in vitro in the context of the current research activities in the field of non-coding RNAs. We speculate that modifier RNAs might also exist in nature; if so, they present an additional regulatory layer for fine-tuning gene expression that could evolve rapidly, leaving no obvious traces in the genomic DNA sequences.

AB  - We report an efficient method for detecting functional RNAs. The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments of length n $>$ or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and found compelling evidence for many other conserved RNA secondary structures not described so far to our knowledge.

Two families of microRNAs are genomically located in intergenic regions in the Hox clusters of vertebrates. Here we describe their evolution in detail. We show that the micro RNAs closely follow the patterns of protein evolution in the Hox clusters, which is characterized by cluster duplications followed by differential gene loss.

For various reasons, such methods may fail to produce biologically meaningful alignments. Herein, we describe a semi-automatic approach to multiple sequence alignment where biological expert knowledge can be used to influence the alignment procedure. The user can specify parts of the sequences that are biologically related to each other; our software program uses these sites as anchor points and creates a multiple alignment respecting these user-defined constraints. By using known functionally, structurally or evolutionarily related positions of the input sequences as anchor points, our method can produce alignments that reflect the true biological relationships among the input sequences more accurately than fully automated procedures can do.

Proteins belonging to the same family are likely to share some of the same protein interaction partners and may thus face a similar selective environment. This common selective environment can induce co-evolutionary pressures and thus can give rise to correlated rates and patterns of evolution among members of a gene family. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a family of sequences which share a set of interaction partners. Depending on the amount of sequence dedicated to protein-protein interaction and the relative rate parameters of sequence evolution three outcomes are possible: if the fraction of the sequence dedicated to interaction with common co-factors is low and the time since divergence is small, the trees based on sequence information tend to be correct. If the time since gene duplication is long two possible outcomes are observed in our simulations. If the rate of evolution of the interaction partner is small compared to the rate of evolution of the focal protein family, the reconstructed trees tend towards star phylogenies. As the rate of evolution of the interaction partner approaches that of the focal protein family the reconstructed phylogenies tend to be incorrectly resolved. We conclude that the genealogies of gene families can be hard to estimate, in particular if the proteins interact with a conserved set of binding partners, as is likely the case for transcription factors.

AB  - Hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development of all animal phyla. In invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. Only in vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from a single ancestral cluster. This history of Hox cluster duplications, in particular during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly understood. In this paper we report the results of a PCR survey on genomic DNA of the pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii. Hagfishes are one of two clades of recent jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. Our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct Hox genes in the hagfish genome, which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple Hox clusters. The largest number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. Quartet mapping reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more closely related to gnathostome Hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey genes. These results support two assumptions about the history of Hox genes: (1) The association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that at least one Hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates. (2) The high number of paralog group 9 sequences in hagfish and the phylogenetic position of hagfish suggests that the hagfish lineage underwent additional independent Hox cluster/-gene duplication events.

IS  - 11
AB  - In many eukaryotic genomes only a small fraction of the DNA codes for proteins, but the non-protein coding DNA harbors important genetic elements directing the development and the physiology of the organisms, like promoters, enhancers, insulators, and micro-RNA genes. The molecular evolution of these genetic elements is difficult to study because their functional significance is hard to deduce from sequence information alone. Here we propose an approach to the study of the rate of evolution of functional non-coding sequences at a macro-evolutionary scale. We identify functionally important non-coding sequences as Conserved Non-Coding Nucleotide (CNCN) sequences from the comparison of two outgroup species. The CNCN sequences so identified are then compared to their homologous sequences in a pair of ingroup species, and we monitor the degree of modification these sequences suffered in the two ingroup lineages. We propose a method to test for rate differences in the modification of CNCN sequences among the two ingroup lineages, as well as a method to estimate their rate of modification. We apply this method to the full sequences of the HoxA clusters from six gnathostome species: a shark, Heterodontus francisci; a basal ray finned fish, Polypterus senegalus; the amphibian, Xenopus tropicalis; as well as three mammalian species, human, rat and mouse. The results show that the evolutionary rate of CNCN sequences is not distinguishable among the three mammalian lineages, while the Xenopus lineage has a significantly increased rate of evolution. Furthermore the estimates of the rate parameters suggest that in the stem lineage of mammals the rate of CNCN sequence evolution was more than twice the rate observed within the placental amniotes clade, suggesting a high rate of evolution of cis-regulatory elements during the origin of amniotes and mammals. We conclude that the proposed methods can be used for testing hypotheses about the rate and pattern of evolution of putative cis-regulatory elements.

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the mir17 microRNA clusters which consist of miR-17, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20, miR-25, miR-92, miR-93, miR-106a, and miR-106b. The history of this cluster is governed by an initial phase of local (tandem) duplications, a series of duplications of entire clusters and subsequent loss of individual microRNAs from the resulting paralogous clusters. The complex history of the mir17 microRNA family appears to be closely linked to the early evolution of the vertebrate lineage.

VL  - 85

AB  - Presented here is a comprehensive computational survey of evolutionarily conserved secondary structure motifs in the genomic RNAs of the family Flaviviridae: This virus family consists of the three genera Flavivirus, Pestivirus and Hepacivirus and the group of GB virus C/hepatitis G virus with a currently uncertain taxonomic classification. Based on the control of replication and translation, two subgroups were considered separately: the genus Flavivirus, with its type I cap structure at the 5? untranslated region (UTR) and a highly structured 3? UTR, and the remaining three groups, which exhibit translation control by means of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5? UTR and a much shorter less-structured 3? UTR. The main findings of this survey are strong hints for the possibility of genome cyclization in hepatitis C virus and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus in addition to the flaviviruses; a surprisingly large number of conserved RNA motifs in the coding regions; and a lower level of detailed structural conservation in the IRES and 3? UTR motifs than reported in the literature. An electronic atlas organizes the information on the more than 150 conserved, and therefore putatively functional, RNA secondary structure elements.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Many classes of functional RNA molecules are characterized by highly conserved secondary structures but little detectable sequence similarity. Reliable multiple alignments can therefore be constructed only when the shared structural features are taken into account. Since multiple alignments are used as input for many subsequent methods of data analysis, structure-based alignments are an indispensable necessity in RNA bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present here a method to compute pairwise and progressive multiple alignments from the direct comparison of base pairing probability matrices. Instead of attempting to solve the folding and the alignment problem simultaneously as in the classical Sankoff?s algorithm, we use McCaskill?s approach to compute base pairing probability matrices which effectively incorporate the information on the energetics of each sequences. A novel, simplified variant of Sankoff?s algorithms can then be employed to extract the maximum-weight common secondary structure and an associated alignment.

VL  - 31
IS  - 2
AB  - Evolutionarily conserved non-coding genomic sequences represent a potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory regions. Since these elements are subject to stabilizing selection they evolve much more slowly than adjacent non-functional DNA. These so-called phylogenetic footprints can be detected by comparison of the sequences surrounding orthologous genes in different species. Therefore the loss of phylogenetic footprints as well as the acquisition of conserved non-coding sequences in some lineages, but not in others, can provide evidence for the evolutionary modification of cis-regulatory elements. We introduce here a statistical model of footprint evolution that allows us to estimate the loss of sequence conservation that can be attributed to gene loss and other structural reasons. This approach to studying the pattern of cis-regulatory element evolution, however, requires the comparison of relatively long sequences from many species. We have therefore developed an efficient software tool for the identification of corresponding footprints in long sequences from multiple species. We apply this novel method to the published sequences of HoxA clusters of shark, human, and the duplicated zebrafish and Takifugu clusters as well as the published HoxB cluster sequences. We find that there is a massive loss of sequence conservation in the intergenic region of the HoxA clusters, consistent with the finding in [Chiu et al., PNAS 99 (2002) 5492]. The loss of conservation after cluster duplication is more extensive than expected from structural reasons. This suggests that binding site turnover and/or adaptive modification may also contribute to the loss of sequence conservation.

AB  - Despite their homology and analogous function, the Hox gene clusters of vertebrates and invertebrates are subject to different constraints on their structural organization. This is demonstrated by a drastically different distribution of repetitive DNA elements in the Hox cluster regions. While gnathostomes have a strong tendency to exclude repetitive DNA elements from the inside of their Hox clusters, no such trend can be detected in the Hox gene clusters of protostomes. Repeats "invade" the gnathostome Hox clusters from the 5? and 3? ends while the core of the clusters remains virtually free of repetitive DNA. This invasion appears to be correlated with relaxed constraints associated with gene loss after cluster duplications.

JO  - Gene

EP  - 14
VL  - 329
AB  - Boudicca is a gypsy-like, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon that has colonized the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni. Previous studies have indicated that more than 1000 copies of Boudicca reside within the S. mansoni genome, although many of them may be degenerate and inactive. Messenger RNAs transcribed from genomic copies of Boudicca were investigated by reverse transcription PCR. Overlapping RT-PCR products corresponding to the gag and pol polyproteins of Boudicca, along with relevant sequences of genomic fragments of Boudicca, were assembled into contigs. Consensus sequences from these contigs were used to predict the sequence and structure of transpositionally active copies of the Boudicca retrotransposon. They verified that Boudicca has a kabuki-like Cys-His box motif at the active site of its gag protein, a classic DTG motif as the active site of the protease domain of the pol ORF2, and indicated a contiguous integrase domain at the C-terminus of pol with strong identity to integrase from the LTR retrotransposons CsRn1 and kabuki, as well as to the conserved integrase core domain, GenBank rve (). Models of the secondary structure of the Boudicca transcript suggested that the first AUG was occluded by a stem loop structure, which in turn suggested a method of regulation of expression, at the level of translation, of Boudicca proteins. In addition, phylogenetic analysis targeting discrete domains of Boudicca revealed a generalized radiation in sequences among the multiple copies of Boudicca resident in the schistosome genome.

SP  - 332
EP  - 8
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
AB  - Phylogenetic footprints are short pieces of noncoding DNA sequence in the vicinity of a gene that are conserved between evolutionary distant species. A seemingly simple problem is to sort footprints in their order along the genomes. It is complicated by the fact that not all footprints are collinear: they may cross each other. The problem thus becomes the identification of the crossing footprints, the sorting of the remaining collinear cliques, and finally the insertion of the noncollinear ones at "reasonable" positions. We show that solving the footprint sorting problem requires the solution of the "Minimum Weight Vertex Feedback Set Problem", which is known to be NP-complete and APX-hard. Nevertheless good approximations can be obtained for data sets of interest. The remaining steps of the sorting process are straightforward: computation of the transitive closure of an acyclic graph, linear extension of the resulting partial order, and finally sorting w.r.t. the linear extension. Alternatively, the footprint sorting problem can be rephrased as a combinatorial optimization problem for which approximate solutions can be obtained by means of general purpose heuristics. Footprint sortings obtained with different methods can be compared using a version of multiple sequence alignment that allows the identification of unambiguously ordered sublists. As an application we show that the rat has a slightly increased insertion/deletion rate in comparison to the mouse genome.

VL  - 44

AB  - Ring information is a large part of the structural topology used to identify and characterize molecular structures. It is hence of crucial importance to obtain this information for a variety of tasks in computational chemistry. Many different approaches for "ring perception", i.e., the extraction of cycles from a molecular graph, have been described. The chemistry literature on this topic, however, reports a surprisingly large number of incorrect statements about the properties of chemically relevant ring sets and, in particular, about the mutual relationships of different sets of cycles in a graph. In part these problems seem to have arisen from a sometimes rather idiosyncratic terminology for notions that are fairly standard in graph theory. In this contribution we translate the definitions of concepts such as the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings, Essential Set of Essential Rings, Extended Set of Smallest Rings, Set of Smallest Cycles at Edges, Set of Elementary Rings, K-rings, and beta-rings into a more widely used mathematical language. We then outline the basic properties of different cycle sets and provide numerous counterexamples to incorrect claims in the published literature. These counterexamples may have a serious practical impact because at least some of them are molecular graphs of well-known molecules. As a consequence, we propose a catalog of desirable properties for chemically useful sets of rings.

AB  - A synthetic proto-organism could be self-assembled by integrating a lipid proto-container with a proto-metabolic subsystem and a proto-genetic subsystem. This three-component system can use energy and nutrients by means of either redox or photo-chemical reactions, evolve its protogenome by means of template directed replication, and ultimately die. The evolutionary dynamics of the proto-organism depends crucially on the chemical kinetics of its sub-systems and on their interplay. In this work the template replication kinetics is investigated and it is found that the product inhibition inherent in the ligation-like replication process allows for coexistence of unrelated self-replicating proto-genes in the lipid surface layer. The combined catalytic effects from the proto-genes on the metabolic production rates determine the fate of the strain protocell.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional RNAs, most prominently the miRNAs have been discovered, strongly suggesting that further types of functional RNAs are still hidden in the recently completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few techniques are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA genes. When sufficiently similar sequences are not available for comparative approaches the only known remedy is to search directly for structural features. RESULTS: We present here efficient algorithms for computing locally stable RNA structures at genome-wide scales. Both the minimum energy structure and the complete matrix of base pairing probabilities can be computed in theta(N x L2) time and theta(N + L2) memory in terms of the length N of the genome and the size L of the largest secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice, the 100 Mb of the complete genome of Caenorhabditis elegans can be folded within about half a day on a modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is sufficient example for a survey for miRNAs.

VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - The study of Hox clusters and genes provides insights into the evolution of genomic regulation of development. Derived ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii, Teleostei) such as zebrafish and pufferfish possess duplicated Hox clusters that have undergone considerable sequence evolution. Whether these changes are associated with the duplication(s) that produced extra Hox clusters is unresolved because comparison with basal lineages is unavailable. We sequenced and analyzed the HoxA cluster of the bichir (Polypterus senegalus), a phylogenetically basal actinopterygian. Independent lines of evidence indicate that bichir has one HoxA cluster that is mosaic in its patterns of noncoding sequence conservation and gene retention relative to the HoxA clusters of human and shark, and the HoxAalpha and HoxAbeta clusters of zebrafish, pufferfish, and striped bass. HoxA cluster noncoding sequences conserved between bichir and euteleosts indicate that novel cis-sequences were acquired in the stem actinopterygians and maintained after cluster duplication. Hence, in the earliest actinopterygians, evolution of the single HoxA cluster was already more dynamic than in human and shark. This tendency peaked among teleosts after HoxA cluster duplication.

AB  - The primordial genetic code probably has been a drastically simplified ancestor of the canonical code that is used by contemporary cells. In order to understand how the present-day code came about we first need to explain how the language of the building plan can change without destroying the encoded information. In this work we introduce a minimal organism model that is based on biophysically reasonable descriptions of RNA and protein, namely secondary structure folding and knowledge based potentials. The evolution of a population of such organism under competition for a common resource is simulated explicitly at the level of individual replication events. Starting with very simple codes, and hence greatly reduced amino acid alphabets, we observe a diversification of the codes in most simulation runs. The driving force behind this effect is the possibility to produce fitter proteins when the repertoire of amino acids is enlarged.

AB  - Large scale chemical reaction networks are a ubiquitous phenomenon, from the metabolism of living cells to processes in planetary atmospheres and chemical technology. At least some of these networks exhibit distinctive global features such as the "small world" behavior. The systematic study of such properties, however, suffers from substantial sampling biases in the few networks that are known in detail. A computational model for generating them is therefore required. Here we present a Toy Model that provides a consistent framework in which generic properties of extensive chemical reaction networks can be explored in detail and that at the same time preserves the "look-and-feel" of chemistry: Molecules are represented as labeled graphs, i.e., by their structural formulas; their basic properties are derived by a caricature version of the Extended H√?ckel MO theory that operates directly on the graphs; chemical reaction mechanisms are implemented as graph rewriting rules acting on the structural formulas; reactivities and selectivities are modeled by a variant of the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory based on the Extended H√?ckel scheme. The approach is illustrated for two types of reaction networks: Diels-Alder reactions and the formose reaction implicated in prebiotic sugar synthesis.

AB  - The phase transition in the number partitioning problem (NPP), i.e., the transition from a region in the space of control parameters in which almost all instances have many solutions to a region in which almost all instances have no solution, is investigated by examining the energy landscape of this classic optimization problem. This is achieved by coding the information about the minimum energy paths connecting pairs of minima into a tree structure, termed a barrier tree, the leaves and internal nodes of which represent, respectively, the minima and the lowest energy saddles connecting those minima. Here we apply several measures of shape (balance and symmetry) as well as of branch lengths (barrier heights) to the barrier trees that result from the landscape of the NPP, aiming at identifying traces of the easy-hard transition. We find that it is not possible to tell the easy regime from the hard one by visual inspection of the trees or by measuring the barrier heights. Only the difficulty measure, given by the maximum value of the ratio between the barrier height and the energy surplus of local minima, succeeded in detecting traces of the phase transition in the tree. In addition, we show that the barrier trees associated with the NPP are very similar to random trees, contrasting dramatically with trees associated with the p spin-glass and random energy models. We also examine critically a recent conjecture on the equivalence between the NPP and a truncated random energy model.

We show that these quantities lead to useful descriptions of the centers of biological networks which often, but not always, correlate with a purely local notion of centrality such as the vertex degree. We introduce the notion of local centers as local optima of a centrality value "landscape" on a network and discuss briefly their role.

AB  - In this paper Lewontin?s notion of "quasi-independence" of characters is formalized as the assumption that a region of the phenotype space can be represented by a product space of orthogonal factors. In this picture each character corresponds to a factor of a region of the phenotype space. We consider any region of the phenotype space that has a given factorization as a "type", i.e. as a set of phenotypes that share the same set of phenotypic characters. Using the notion of local factorizations we develop a theory of character identity based on the continuation of common factors among different regions of the phenotype space. We also consider the topological constraints on evolutionary transitions among regions with different regional factorizations, i.e. for the evolution of new types or body plans. It is shown that direct transition between different "types" is only possible if the transitional forms have all the characters that the ancestral and the derived types have and are thus compatible with the factorization of both types. Transitional forms thus have to go over a "complexity hump" where they have more quasi-independent characters than either the ancestral as well as the derived type. The only logical, but biologically unlikely, alternative is a "hopeful monster" that transforms in a single step from the ancestral type to the derived type. Topological considerations also suggest a new factor that may contribute to the evolutionary stability of "types". It is shown that if the type is decomposable into factors which are vertex irregular (i.e. have states that are more or less preferred in a random walk), the region of phenotypes representing the type contains islands of strongly preferred states. In other words types have a statistical tendency of retaining evolutionary trajectories within their interior and thus add to the evolutionary persistence of types.

JO  - Bioinformatics

VL  - 18 Suppl 2
AB  - MOTIVATION: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist, and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary. RESULTS: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilities P(ij) of a match between position i in the first and position j in the second sequence. Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights. A comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment in order to gain reliability information not available from a single optimal alignment.

AB  - The search spaces in combinatorial chemistry as well as the sequence spaces underlying (molecular) evolution are conventionally thought of as graphs. Recombination, however, implies a nongraphical structure of the combinatorial search spaces. These structures, and their implications for search process itself, are heretofore not well understood in general. In this contribution we review a very general formalism from point set topology and discuss its application to combinatorial search spaces, fitness landscapes, evolutionary trajectories, and artificial chemistries.

AB  - Most functional RNA molecules have characteristic secondary structures that are highly conserved in evolution. Here we present a method for computing the consensus structure of a set aligned RNA sequences taking into account both thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation. Comparison with phylogenetic structures of rRNAs shows that a reliability of prediction of more than 80% is achieved for only five related sequences. As an application we show that the Early Noduline mRNA contains significant secondary structure that is supported by sequence covariation.

AB  - The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype-phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution-such as punctuation, irreversibility, modularity?result naturally from the properties of this space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype-phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in the genotype-phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories. We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the genotype-phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a few results illustrating how this framework can be put to work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text.

AB  - The family Picornaviridae contains important pathogens including, for example, hepatitis A virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The genome of these viruses is a single messenger-active (+)-RNA of 7200-8500 nt. Besides coding for the viral proteins, it also contains functionally important RNA secondary structures, among them an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region towards the 5?-end. This contribution provides a comprehensive computational survey of the complete genomic RNAs and a detailed comparative analysis of the conserved structural elements in seven of the currently nine genera in the family PICORNAVIRIDAE: Compared with previous studies we find: (i) that only smaller sections of the IRES region than previously reported are conserved at single base-pair resolution and (ii) that there is a number of significant structural elements in the coding region. Furthermore, we identify potential cis-acting replication elements in four genera where this feature has not been reported so far.

AB  - Knowledge-based potentials can be used to decide whether an amino acid sequence is likely to fold into a prescribed native protein structure. We use this idea to survey the sequence-structure relations in protein space. In particular, we test the following two propositions which were found to be important for efficient evolution: the sequences folding into a particular native fold form extensive neutral networks that percolate through sequence space. The neutral networks of any two native folds approach each other to within a few point mutations. Computer simulations using two very different potential functions, M. Sippl?s PROSA pair potential and a neural network based potential, are used to verify these claims.

AB  - We show that the problem of designing RNA sequences that can fold into multiple stable secondary structures can be transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem that can be solved by means of simple heuristics. Hence it is feasible to design RNA switches with prescribed structural alternatives. We discuss the theoretical background and present an efficient tool that allows the design of various types of switches. We argue that both the general properties of the sequence structure map of RNA secondary structures and the ease with which our design tool finds bistable RNAs strongly indicates that RNA switches are easily accessible in evolution. Thus conformational switches are yet another function for which RNA can be employed.

AB  - A class of autocatalytic reaction networks based on template-dependent ligation and higher-order catalysis is analysed. Apart from an irreversible ligation reaction we consider only reversible aggregation steps that provide a realistic description of molecular recognition. The overall dynamics can be understood by means of replicator equations with highly non-linear interaction functions. The dynamics depends crucially on the total concentration c0 of replicating material. For small c0, in the hyperbolic growth regime, we recover the familiar dynamics of second-order replicator equations with its wealth of complex dynamics ranging from multi-stability to periodic and strange attractors as well as to heteroclinic orbits. For large c0, in the parabolic growth regime, product inhibition becomes dominating and we observe a single globally stable equilibrium tantamount to permanent coexistence. In an intermediate parameter range we sometimes observe a behavior that is reminiscent of ?survival of the fittest?. Independently replicating species (Schl√∂gl?s model) and the hypercycle are discussed in detail.

AB  - We study analytically the steady-state regime of a network of n error-prone self-replicating templates forming an asymmetric hypercycle and its error tail. We show that the existence of a master template with a higher noncatalyzed self-replicative productivity a than the error tail ensures the stability of chains in which m $<$ n-1 templates coexist with the master species. The stability of these chains against the error tail is guaranteed for catalytic coupling strengths K on the order of a. We find that the hypercycle becomes more stable than the chains only if K is on the order of a2. Furthermore, we show that the minimal replication accuracy per template needed to maintain the hypercycle, the so-called error threshold, vanishes as square root of n/K for large K and N $<$ or = 4.

Because continuity is a topological property, we present a formalism that treats the space of phenotypes as a (finite) topological space, with a topology that is derived from the probabilities with which one phenotype is accessible from another through changes at the genotypic level. The shape space of RNA secondary structures is used to illustrate this approach. We show that evolutionary trajectories are continuous if and only if they follow connected paths in phenotype space.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting one in 3,500 individuals. The mutation rate in the NF1 gene is one of the highest known for human genes. Compared to other methods, the protein truncation test (PTT) provides improved efficiency in detecting NF1 mutations which are dispersed throughout the gene which spans 350 kilobases of genomic DNA. We have applied the PTT and subsequent sequence analysis of cloned cDNA to identify mutations in NF1 patients. We report here the identification of two novel (W336X and Q315X), and one recurrent (R304X) mutation located in exon 7 and show that all three premature termination codons lead to skipping of exon 7 in a proportion of the transcripts derived from the mutated allele. Possible mutation-induced alterations of the RNA secondary structure and their impact on skipping of exon 7 of the NF1 gene are explored and discussed. Copyright Wiley-Liss, Inc.

JO  - Bull Math Biol
SP  - 399

VL  - 62
IS  - 3
AB  - The effect of recombination on genotypes can be represented in the form of P-structures, i.e., a map from the set of pairs of genotypes to the power set of genotypes. The interpretation is that the P-structure maps the pair of parental genotypes to the set of recombinant genotypes which result from the recombination of the parental genotypes. A recombination fitness landscape is then a function from the genotypes in a P-structure to the real numbers. In previous papers we have shown that the eigenfunctions of (a matrix associated with) the P-structure provide a basis for the Fourier decomposition of arbitrary recombination landscapes. Here we generalize this framework to include the effect of genotype frequencies, assuming linkage equilibrium. We find that the autocorrelation of the eigenfunctions of the population-weighted P-structure is independent of the population composition. As a consequence we can directly compare the performance of mutation and recombination operators by comparing the autocorrelations on the finite set of elementary landscapes. This comparison suggests that point mutation is a superior search strategy on landscapes with a low order and a moderate order of interaction p $<$ n/3 (n is the number of loci). For more complex landscapes 1-point recombination is superior to both mutation and uniform recombination, but only if the distance among the interacting loci (defining length) is minimal. Furthermore we find that the autocorrelation on any landscape is increasing as the distribution of genotypes becomes more extreme, i.e., if the population occupies a location close to the boundary of the frequency simplex. Landscapes are smoother the more biased the distribution of genotype frequencies is. We suggest that this result explains the paradox that there is little epistatic interaction for quantitative traits detected in natural populations if one uses variance decomposition methods while there is evidence for strong interactions in molecular mapping studies for quantitative trait loci.

An evolutionary origin of robustness would require a rethinking of key concepts in the field of molecular evolution, such as gene-specific neutral mutation rates, or the context-independence of deleterious mutations. We provide evidence that mutational robustness of the genome of RNA viruses to mutational changes in secondary structure has evolved. J. Exp. Zool. ( Mol. Dev. Evol.) 285:119-127, 1999.

AB  - Almost all RNA molecules?and consequently also almost all subsequences of a large RNA molecule-form secondary structures. The presence of secondary structure in itself therefore does not indicate any functional significance. In fact, we cannot expect a conserved secondary structure for all parts of a viral genome or a mRNA, even if there is a significant level of sequence conservation. We present a novel method for detecting conserved RNA secondary structures in a family of related RNA sequences. The method is based on combining the prediction of base pair probability matrices and comparative sequence analysis. It can be applied to small sets of long sequences and does not require a prior knowledge of conserved sequence or structure motifs. As such it can be used to scan large amounts of sequence data for regions that warrant further experimental investigation. Applications to complete genomic RNAs of some viruses show that in all cases the known secondary structure features are identified. In addition, we predict a substantial number of conserved structural elements which have not been described so far.

AB  - A new mathematical representation is proposed for the configuration space structure induced by recombination, which we call "P-structure." It consists of a mapping of pairs of objects to the power set of all objects in the search space. The mapping assigns to each pair of parental "genotypes" the set of all recombinant genotypes obtainable from the parental ones. It is shown that this construction allows a Fourier decomposition of fitness landscapes into a superposition of "elementary landscapes." This decomposition is analogous to the Fourier decomposition of fitness landscapes on mutation spaces. The elementary landscapes are obtained as eigenfunctions of a Laplacian operator defined for P-structures. For binary string recombination, the elementary landscapes are exactly the p-spin functions (Walsh functions), that is, the same as the elementary landscapes of the string point mutation spaces (i.e., the hypercube). This supports the notion of a strong homomorphism between string mutation and recombination spaces. However, the effective nearest neighbor correlations on these elementary landscapes differ between mutation and recombination and among different recombination operators. On average, the nearest neighbor correlation is higher for one-point recombination than for uniform recombination. For one-point recombination, the correlations are higher for elementary landscapes with fewer interacting sites as well as for sites that have closer linkage, confirming the qualitative predictions of the Schema Theorem. We conclude that the algebraic approach to fitness landscape analysis can be extended to recombination spaces and provides an effective way to analyze the relative hardness of a landscape for a given recombination operator.

AB  - The theory of autocatalytic binary ligation is reviewed within the context of a consistently applied Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady-state approximation to obtain explicit analytical results describing time-course data from experiments. A detailed protocol for the step-wise elucidation of a minimal set of experimental parameters is outlined. The kinetic equations are then generalized to cases of self- and cross-catalysis among an arbitrary number of different templates and applied to experiments involving just two templates. Depending on the values of various kinetic parameters such systems can display exclusionary Darwinian selection corresponding to an exponential growth law, selective coexistence or coexistence of all species characteristic of a parabolic growth law; the intermediate behaviour arises as a property of the full mechanism analysed here. Our results are applicable to the classical case of self-replicating nucleic acids and their analogues as well as to newly discovered self-replicating peptides.

AB  - Novel species are introduced into a network of interacting replicators either (i) as mutants of members of the network (ii) as unrelated immigrants. We consider the meta-population dynamics of such a system. In the first case the appearance of mutants leads to a slow growth of the replicator network, proportional to the logarithm of the number of mutation events. Surprisingly, replicators evolved by mutant incorporation are always permanent, despite the fact that permanence is in general a very rare phenomenon. In the second case, on the other hand, immigrants lead to frequent break-downs on the entire network and hence to complete extinction. In both cases individual species are short-lived and the distribution of survival times is exponential.

Our method is based on a combination of thermodynamic structure prediction and phylogenetic comparison. In contrast to purely phylogenetic methods, our algorithm can be used for small data sets of approximately 10 sequences, efficiently exploiting the information contained in the sequence variability. The procedure constructs a prediction only for those parts of sequences that are consistent with a single conserved structure. Our implementation produces reasonable consensus structures without user interference. As an example we have analysed the complete HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomes as well as the small segment of hantavirus. Our method confirms the known structures in HIV-1 and predicts previously unknown conserved RNA secondary structures in HCV.

VL  - 72
IS  - 3
AB  - The flavivirus genome is a positive-strand RNA molecule containing a single long open reading frame flanked by noncoding regions (NCR) that mediate crucial processes of the viral life cycle. The 3? NCR of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus can be divided into a variable region that is highly heterogeneous in length among strains of TBE virus and in certain cases includes an internal poly(A) tract and a 3?-terminal conserved core element that is believed to fold as a whole into a well-defined secondary structure. We have now investigated the genetic stability of the TBE virus 3? NCR and its influence on viral growth properties and virulence. We observed spontaneous deletions in the variable region during growth of TBE virus in cell culture and in mice. These deletions varied in size and location but always included the internal poly(A) element of the TBE virus 3? NCR and never extended into the conserved 3?-terminal core element. Subsequently, we constructed specific deletion mutants by using infectious cDNA clones with the entire variable region and increasing segments of the core element removed. A virus mutant lacking the entire variable region was indistinguishable from wild-type virus with respect to cell culture growth properties and virulence in the mouse model. In contrast, even small extensions of the deletion into the core element led to significant biological effects. Deletions extending to nucleotides 10826, 10847, and 10870 caused distinct attenuation in mice without measurable reduction of cell culture growth properties, which, however, were significantly restricted when the deletion was extended to nucleotide 10919. An even larger deletion (to nucleotide 10994) abolished viral viability. In spite of their high degree of attenuation, these mutants efficiently induced protective immune responses even at low inoculation doses. Thus, 3?-NCR deletions represent a useful technique for achieving stable attenuation of flaviviruses that can be included in the rational design of novel flavivirus live vaccines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many protein sequences, often unrelated, adopt similar folds. Sequences folding into the same shape thus form subsets of sequence space. The shape and the connectivity of these sets have implications for protein evolution and de novo design. RESULTS: We investigate the topology of these sets for some proteins with known three-dimensional structure using inverse folding techniques. First, we find that sequences adopting a given fold do not cluster in sequence space and that there is no detectable sequence homology among them. Nevertheless, these sequences are connected in the sense that there exists a path such that every sequence can be reached from every other sequence while the fold remains unchanged. We find similar results for restricted amino acid alphabets in some cases (e. g. ADLG). In other cases, it seems impossible to find sequences with native-like behavior (e.g. QLR). These findings seem to be independent of the particular structure considered. CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid sequences folding into a common shape are distributed homogeneously in sequence space. Hence, the connectivity of the set of these sequences implies the existence of very long neutral paths on all examined protein structures. Regarding protein design, these results imply that sequences with more or less arbitrary chemical properties can be attached to a given structural framework. But we also observe that designability varies significantly among native structures. These features of protein sequence space are similar to what has been found for nucleic acids.

AB  - The prediction of the complete matrix of base pairing probabilities was applied to the 3? noncoding region (NCR) of flavivirus genomes. This approach identifies not only well-defined secondary structure elements, but also regions of high structural flexibility. Flaviviruses, many of which are important human pathogens, have a common genomic organization, but exhibit a significant degree of RNA sequence diversity in the functionally important 3?-NCR. We demonstrate the presence of secondary structures shared by all flaviviruses, as well as structural features that are characteristic for groups of viruses within the genus reflecting the established classification scheme. The significance of most of the predicted structures is corroborated by compensatory mutations. The availability of infectious clones for several flaviviruses will allow the assessment of these structural elements in processes of the viral life cycle, such as replication and assembly.

AB  - Prediction and modeling of RNA structures has become an indispensable tool of biological research disciplines. Currently, reliable predictions require massive input of experimental data. Structure-forming elements are conventional base pairs, as well as a rapidly increasing repertoire of novel structural motifs. New developments extend structural analysis beyond the one-sequence/one-structure paradigm and allow questions that are relevant to molecular evolution to be answered.

VL  - 59
IS  - 2
AB  - Random graph theory is used to model and analyse the relationships between sequences and secondary structures of RNA molecules, which are understood as mappings from sequence space into shape space. These maps are non-invertible since there are always many orders of magnitude more sequences than structures. Sequences folding into identical structures form neutral networks. A neutral network is embedded in the set of sequences that are compatible with the given structure. Networks are modeled as graphs and constructed by random choice of vertices from the space of compatible sequences. The theory characterizes neutral networks by the mean fraction of neutral neighbors (lambda). The networks are connected and percolate sequence space if the fraction of neutral nearest neighbors exceeds a threshold value (lambda $>$ lambda *). Below threshold (lambda $<$ lambda *), the networks are partitioned into a largest "giant" component and several smaller components. Structures are classified as "common" or "rare" according to the sizes of their pre-images, i.e. according to the fractions of sequences folding into them. The neutral networks of any pair of two different common structures almost touch each other, and, as expressed by the conjecture of shape space covering sequences folding into almost all common structures, can be found in a small ball of an arbitrary location in sequence space. The results from random graph theory are compared to data obtained by folding large samples of RNA sequences. Differences are explained in terms of specific features of RNA molecular structures.

AB  - A class of autocatalytic reaction networks based on template-dependent replication and specific catalysis is considered. Trimolecular "elementary steps" of simple replicator dynamics are resolved into two consecutive irreversible reactions. The extreme cases, competition for common resources and hypercycle-like cooperative feedback, were analyzed in some detail. Although the dynamics of the extended networks resembles corresponding replicator dynamics in general, there are significant differences. Most notably, the interior fixed points in the cooperative model turned out to be asymptotically stable for an arbitrary number of species, whereas simple replicator dynamic predicts an asymptotically stable periodic orbit fixed for four species and fewer and a stable periodic orbit for all other cases.

AB  - Detailed knowledge of the energy landscape of a biopolymer molecule is a prerequisite for understanding its folding kinetics and its final spatial structure. In the case of RNA we consider the energy landscape defined on the set of all secondary structures that can be formed by a given sequence. We show that the exploration of this energy landscapes is computationally feasible. For this purpose we present a recursive algorithm for computing the complete density of states and discuss its application to tRNA sequences. For shorter sequences a more detailed analysis of the energy surface is possible using a complete list of all secondary structures. In this case we identify metastable states and the saddle points that connect them.

AB  - RNA free energy landscapes are analysed by means of "time-series" that are obtained from random walks restricted to excursion sets. The power spectra, the scaling of the jump size distribution, and the scaling of the curve length measured with different yard stick lengths are used to describe the structure of these "time series". Although they are stationary by construction, we find that their local behavior is consistent with both AR(1) and self-affine processes. Random walks confined to excursion sets (i.e., with the restriction that the fitness value exceeds a certain threshold at each step) exhibit essentially the same statistics as free random walks. We find that an AR(1) time series is in general approximately self-affine on timescales up to approximately the correlation length. We present an empirical relation between the correlation parameter rho of the AR(1) model and the exponents characterizing self-affinity.

AB  - Selection of molecules with desired properties from random pools of biopolymers has become a powerful tool in biotechnology. On designing an evolution experiment, a certain knowledge of the concomitant fitness landscape is clearly helpful to set up the optimal experimental conditions. The correlation function is a useful means of characterizing a given landscape, since it can be efficiently measured if one has a method of separating a pool of random sequences according to their Hamming distance from a moderately small number of test sequences. In this paper we describe a special type of hybridization chromatography, where a mixture of oligomers (partially) complementary to a given test sequence is hybridized to the test sequence, covalently bound to a matrix. DNA oligomers are eluted in an ?effective temperature gradient? using conditions that minimize the differences of effects of GC versus AT pairs on the melting temperatures. This method should be a means to quickly separate error classes and thus be the crucial step in characterizing fitness landscapes of biopolymers through an experimental approach. It would also be a useful tool to design sequence pools with a bias towards desired mutant spectra.

On the other hand, one can find properties of the graphs, for example, reducibility or the presence of endpoints, that are incompatible with permanence.

AB  - RNA secondary structure folding algorithms predict the existence of connected networks of RNA sequences with identical structure. On such networks, evolving populations split into subpopulations, which diffuse independently in sequence space. This demands a distinction between two mutation thresholds: one at which genotypic information is lost and one at which phenotypic information is lost. In between, diffusion enables the search of vast areas in genotype space while still preserving the dominant phenotype. By this dynamic the success of phenotypic adaptation becomes much less sensitive to the initial conditions in genotype space.

AB  - We have calculated the base pair probability distribution for the secondary structure of a full length HIV-1 genome using the partition function approach introduced by McCaskill (1990). By analyzing the full distribution of base pair probabilities instead of a restricted number of secondary structures, we gain more complete and reliable information about the secondary structure of HIV-1. We introduce methods that condense the information in the probability distribution to one value per nucleotide in the sequence. Using these methods we represent the secondary structure as a weighted average of the base pair probabilities, and we can identify interesting secondary structures that have relatively well-defined base pairing. The results show high probabilities for the known secondary structures at the 5?-end of the molecule that have been predicted on the basis of biochemical data. The Rev response element (RRE) appears as a distinct element in the secondary structure. It has a meta-stable domain at the high affinity site for the binding of Rev. The overall structure decomposes into fairly small independent structures in the first 4,000 bases of the molecule. The remaining 5,000 bases (excluding the terminal repeat) form a single, large structure, on top of which the RRE is located.

VL  - 18
IS  - 3
AB  - The evolution of RNA molecules in replication assays, viroids and RNA viruses can be viewed as an adaptation process on a ?fitness? landscape. The dynamics of evolution is hence tightly linked to the structure of the underlying landscape. Global features of landscapes can be described by statistical measures like number of optima, lengths of walks and correlation functions. The evolution of a quasispecies on such landscapes exhibits three dynamical regimes depending on the replication fidelity: Above the "localization threshold" the population is centered around a (local) optimum. Between localization and "dispersion threshold" the population is still centered around a consensus sequence, which, however, changes in time. For very large mutation rates the population spreads in sequence space like a gas. The critical mutation rates separating the three domains depend strongly on characteristics properties of the fitness landscapes. Statistical characteristics of RNA landscapes are accessible by mathematical analysis and computer calculations on the level of secondary structures: these RNA landscapes belong to the same class as well known optimization problems and simple spin glass models. The notion of a landscape is extended to combinatory maps, thereby allowing for a direct statistical investigation of the sequence structure relationships of RNA at the level of secondary structures. Frequencies of structures are highly non-uniform: we find relatively few common and many rare ones, as expressed by a generalized form of Zipf?s law. Using an algorithm for inverse folding we show that sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly over sequence space. Together with calculations of structure correlations and a survey of neutral mutations this provides convincing evidence that RNA landscapes are as simple as they could possibly be for evolutionary adaptation: Any desired secondary structure can be found close to an arbitrary initial sequence and at the same time almost all bases can be substituted sequentially without ever changing the shape of the molecule. Consequences of these results for evolutionary optimization, the early stages of life, and molecular biotechnology are discussed.

AB  - A particular class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing catalyzed, template-induced, and erroneous replication is investigated. The ODEs can be split into a replicator part accounting for the correct replication and a mutation term accounting for all miscopying processes. The set of all species is divided into the catalytically active "viable" species and an error tail subsuming all other species. Neglecting both the intermutation among the viable species and the reflux from the error tail allows for an extensive analysis of the autocatalytic network. If mutation rates are small enough, a perturbation approach is feasible showing that mutation in general simplifies the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system. Special cases, such as Schl√∂gl?s model, the uniform model, and the hypercycle, show that the viable species become unstable beyond a critical mutation rate: There is an analogue to the error threshold of the quasi-species model also in nonlinear autocatalytic reaction networks with mutation.

AB  - RNA folding is viewed here as a map assigning secondary structures to sequences. At fixed chain length the number of sequences far exceeds the number of structures. Frequencies of structures are highly non-uniform and follow a generalized form of Zipf?s law: we find relatively few common and many rare ones. By using an algorithm for inverse folding, we show that sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly over sequence space. All common structures can be accessed from an arbitrary sequence by a number of mutations much smaller than the chain length. The sequence space is percolated by extensive neutral networks connecting nearest neighbours folding into identical structures. Implications for evolutionary adaptation and for applied molecular evolution are evident: finding a particular structure by mutation and selection is much simpler than expected and, even if catalytic activity should turn out to be sparse of RNA structures, it can hardly be missed by evolutionary processes.

AB  - In order to evaluate the role of idiotypic networks in the operation of the immune system a number of mathematical models have been formulated. Here we examine a class of B-cell models in which cell proliferation is governed by a non-negative, unimodal, symmetric response function f (h), where the field h summarizes the effect of the network on a single clone. We show that by transforming into relative concentrations, the B-cell network equations can be brought into a form that closely resembles the replicator equation. We then show that when the total number of clones in a network is conserved, the dynamics of the network can be represented by the dynamics of a replicator equation. The number of equilibria and their stability are then characterized using methods developed for the study of second-order replicator equations. Analogies with standard Lotka-Volterra equations are also indicated. A particularly interesting result of our analysis is the fact that even though the immune network equations are not second-order, the number and stability of their equilibria can be obtained by a superposition of second-order replicator systems. As a consequence, the problem of finding all of the equilibrium points of the nonlinear network equations can be reduced to solving linear equations.

The major part of the anisotropy of the GCAU landscapes arises from the difference of the G identical to C and the A = U stacking parameters.

AB  - A statistical reference for RNA secondary structures with minimum free energies is computed by folding large ensembles of random RNA sequences. Four nucleotide alphabets are used: two binary alphabets, AU and GC, the biophysical AUGC and the synthetic GCXK alphabet. RNA secondary structures are made of structural elements, such as stacks, loops, joints, and free ends. Statistical properties of these elements are computed for small RNA molecules of chain lengths up to 100. The results of RNA structure statistics depend strongly on the particular alphabet chosen. The statistical reference is compared with the data derived from natural RNA molecules with similar base frequencies. Secondary structures are represented as trees. Tree editing provides a quantitative measure for the distance dt, between two structures. We compute a structure density surface as the conditional probability of two structures having distance t given that their sequences have distance h. This surface indicates that the vast majority of possible minimum free energy secondary structures occur within a fairly small neighborhood of any typical (random) sequence. Correlation lengths for secondary structures in their tree representations are computed from probability densities. They are appropriate measures for the complexity of the sequence-structure relation. The correlation length also provides a quantitative estimate for the mean sensitivity of structures to point mutations.

IS  - 2
AB  - Many biological and biochemical measurements, for example the "fitness" of a particular genome, or the binding affinity to a particular substrate, can be treated as a "fitness landscape", an assignment of numerical values to points in sequence space (or some other configuration space). As an alternative to the enormous amount of data required to completely describe such a landscape, we propose a statistical characterization, based on the properties of a random walk through the landscape and, more specifically, its autocorrelation function. Under assumptions roughly satisfied by two classes of simple model landscapes (the N-k model and the p-spin model) and by the landscape of estimated free energies of RNA secondary structures, this autocorrelation function, along with the mean and variance of individual points and the size of the landscape, completely characterize it. Having noted that these and other landscapes of estimated replication and degradation rates all have a well-defined correlation length, we propose a classification of landscapes depending on how the correlation length scales with the diameter of the landscape. The landscapes of some of the kinetic parameters of RNA molecules scale similarly to the model landscapes introduced into evolutionary studies from other fields, such as quadratic spin glasses and the traveling salesman problem, but the correlation length of RNA landscapes are considerably smaller. Nevertheless, both the model and some of the RNA landscapes satisfy a test of self-similarity proposed by Sorkin (1988).

There is strong evidence that the probability for cooperative behavior in random networks decreases at least exponentially and at most as an2 with the number n of interacting species. The evolution of larger persistent networks by subsequent incorporation of additional species into a cooperative network is shown to be even less probable. This leads to the conclusion that hypercycle-type interactions alone are not sufficient to maintain the genetic information of more than a few interacting species in a pure RNA world.

AB  - Statistical properties of RNA folding landscapes obtained by the partition function algorithm (McCaskill 1990) are investigated in detail. The pair correlation of free energies as a function of the Hamming distance is used as a measure for the ruggedness of the landscape. The calculation of the partition function contains information about the entire ensemble of secondary structures as a function of temperature and opens the door to all quantities of thermodynamic interest, in contrast with the conventional minimal free energy approach. A metric distance of structure ensembles is introduced and pair correlations at the level of the structures themselves are computed. Just as with landscapes based on most stable secondary structure prediction, the landscapes defined on the full biophysical GCAU alphabet are much smoother than the landscapes restricted to pure GC sequences and the correlation lengths are almost constant fractions of the chain lengths. Correlation functions for multi-structure landscape exhibit an increased correlation length, especially near the melting temperature. However, the main effect on evolution is rather an effective increase in sampling for finite populations where each sequence explores multiple structures.

AB  - A class of kinetic equations describing catalysed and template induced replication, and mutation is introduced. This ODE in its most general form is split into two vector fields, a replication and a mutation field. The mutation field is considered as a perturbation of the replicator equation. The perturbation expansion is a Taylor series in a mutation parameter lambda. First, second and higher order contributions are computed by means of the conventional Rayleigh-Schr√∂dinger approach. Qualitative shift in the positions of rest points and limit cycles on the boundary of the physically meaningful part of concentration space are predicted from flow topologies. The results of the topological analysis are summarized in two theorems which turned out to be useful in applications: the rest point migration theorem (RPM) and the limit cycle migration theorem (LCM). Quantitative expressions for the shifts of rest points are computed directly from the perturbation expansion. The concept is applied to a collection of selected examples from biophysical chemistry and biology.

Two special cases of replication, and the influence of mutation on them, have been studied in detail. In the case of first-order mass action kinetics?the quasi-species model?complementary replication, like direct replication, exhibits an error threshold for the replication accuracy, below which the genetic information is lost. In turns out that the long-time behavior of many special cases of the second-order kinetics model can be described in terms of second-order replicator equations, although this is not possible in general.

It is shown that the total concentration of replicating material determines the relative importance of the first order and the second order mechanism. A complete description of the dynamics of the first order model and some special features of the inhomogeneous replicator equation are presented. A minimal prebiotic scenario with the potentiality to develop cooperation is derived from the inhomogeneous replicator equation. In this model cooperation can emerge when the total concentration of replication material exceeds a certain threshold. Below this value, a single species is selected; which one is determined by the rate constants of the first order reaction alone. Above this threshold the second order process becomes important and may lead to cooperative behavior such as hypercycles.
