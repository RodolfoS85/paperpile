* Feature ideas
** Export-mode, define several targets (endnote, bibtex, RSS) and constantly export in time intervals
*** eg. also export as html, for including publication list on website. 
** E-mail references/pdfs?
** "Tell others about PaperPile" link
** External information for authors (facebook??), journals (website, logo), books (amazon?)
** Context: google ads, wiki.
** Browse journals and give links to current issue
** Add full text search with pdftotext and sqlite
** Phone home feature: send message to server when specific function is used, to get statistics how people are using different features
** collect news feeds and match search terms, show full news on online page to show ads
** Not only subject tags but also technical tags like 'read later', 'read', or anything else
** home-screen with configurable "news" elements like RSS
